The [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) team has expressed a feeling of "closure" after the juggernaut game completed its victory lap. 

Baldur's Gate 3 had been quietly bubbling away in early access for years, before launching to massive commercial and critical success. The RPG threequel unexpectedly became [one of the best-selling hits of last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-starfield-and-hogwarts-legacy-are-steams-most-played-and-best-selling-2023-games/), and just recently, its record-breaking status reached new heights as it [won all five major Game of the Year awards](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-passes-elden-ring-and-breath-of-the-wild-to-become-first-game-to-win-all-five-major-goty-awards/). 

Baldur's Gate 3 became the first game in history to win gold at The Game Awards, the DICE Awards, the Game Developers Choice Awards, the Golden Joysticks, and the BAFTAs - and that last accolade is what bookmarked this chapter for some development leads. 

"The BAFTAs really felt like the proper closure," studio founder and game director Swen Vincke explains in a recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1780961858775560257), while also teasing that he's "crazy hyped about what's next but it's going to take a while."

"Seconded. Closure was needed," publishing director Micheal Douse [chimes in](https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1780964401782124957). "I can't wait to focus on the future and get back to work and put my amazing team to good use. I am not someone designed to twiddle thumbs and smile politely."

Both developers seem to have closed a page on Baldur's Gate 3, especially after announcing that an [expansion or a Baldur's Gate 4 won't come from developer Larian Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/larian-is-done-with-baldurs-gate-3-and-dandd-and-wont-make-baldurs-gate-4-well-forever-be-proud-of-it-but-were-not-going-to-continue-in-it/). The team instead seems to be working on something completely original, while [D&D license holder Hasbro is already "talking to lots of partners"](https://www.gamesradar.com/dandd-owner-hasbro-is-already-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-the-next-baldurs-gate-game-and-hopes-its-not-another-25-years-before-it-comes-out/) to avoid another quarter-century break between Baldur's Gates.
