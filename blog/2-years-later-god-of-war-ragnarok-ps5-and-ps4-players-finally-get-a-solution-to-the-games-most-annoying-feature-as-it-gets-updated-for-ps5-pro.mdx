[God of War Ragnarok](https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok/) fans on [PlayStation](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/playstation/) rejoice: the [PS4](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/playstation/ps4/) and [PS5](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/playstation/ps5/) versions of the game are finally getting an update that adds an option to reduce the frequency that your companions will give you hints while completing puzzles.

Developer [Sony Santa Monica](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/santa-monica-studio/) announced the news via a tweet yesterday, November 7, 2024. When the game launched, it was met with mass critical and fan acclaim, but [one feature many](https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-players-just-want-a-little-more-time-to-solve-puzzles/)[<u> people agreed was annoying</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-players-just-want-a-little-more-time-to-solve-puzzles/) was how often Kratos' companions would give him unsolicited hints while completing puzzles.

Kratos has never been all brawn and no brain. Puzzles have been an integral part of the God of War series since the start, back in Greece when the Spartan had no companions to advise him. The combat style may have changed, but he's still a smart man. If anything, he's only gotten wiser with age.

[<u>PC players got this option</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/god-of-war-ragnaroks-pc-port-is-getting-two-new-features-before-the-ps5-version-and-one-of-them-stops-companions-from-spoiling-puzzles/) back in September, before the PS5 players. Most games on PC and console tend to see PC changes first, so this isn't out of the ordinary, but it's good to see the PlayStation versions getting parity now.

Although this is definitely my favorite part of the update, it isn't the only feature included. New audio descriptions make the game's cinematics more accessible. However, this feature isn't coming to the wider gameplay.

There are also [PS5 Pro](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-pro/) enhancements for those who have already purchased one. You'll be able to play with high image quality and maintain a smooth 60fps. If 60 isn't enough for you, there's also a high frame rate mode for those with variable refresh rate monitors. The performance mode will also see a boost, though [<u>the patch notes</u>](https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/31642737345293-Patch-Notes-v-06-00) don't explain what exactly this entails.
