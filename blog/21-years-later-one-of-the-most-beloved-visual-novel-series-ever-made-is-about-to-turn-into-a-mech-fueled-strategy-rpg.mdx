If you've ever dipped even a toe into the vast ocean of the world of visual novels, you've probably come across Muv-Luv, a 21-year-old series that reigns as one of the genre's most beloved names. Now, it's about to achieve its final form: a mech-fueled strategy RPG.

Muv-Luv Tactics was announced this week with a brief teaser trailer showcasing a few mech designs, and bit of text in that trailer confirms that it will be a strategy RPG - pretty much what you'd expect from a game with 'Tactics' in the name. [Gematsu](https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/strategy-rpg-muv-luv-tactics-announced)'s translation of the announcement notes that the game will be crowdfunded, and additional details will be revealed at a "Muv-Luv Day" event on October 19. 

The original Muv-Luv launched in Japan back in 2003, and at a glance, you'd probably have a hard time distinguishing it from any number of other visual novels. You play as a high school boy who's unremarkable but nonetheless pursued by an array of female love interests and, you know, hijinks ensue - it's basically what you'd expect.

But over the course of the series, the story turns into a timeline-hopping sci-fi war epic with much higher stakes. 2006's Muv-Luv Alternative is seen as one of the high points of the entire visual novel genre - it's currently the number two top-rated game on tracking site [VNDB](https://vndb.org/v?cfil=&f=&fil=&rfil=&s=24w), and it enjoys overwhelmingly positive reviews on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/802890/MuvLuv_Alternative/). English-language versions of these games first hit PC back in 2016, and they were ported to Switch earlier this year.

The throughline from 'high school romance VN' to 'mech-filled tactics game' might not make a lot of sense if you haven't followed the series, but it's fully true to the shape Muv-Luv has taken over the years. There's no word on whether Muv-Luv Tactics will get an English-language release, but given the series' recent ports and the sheer volume of worldwide visual novel releases we've seen recently - from [Tsukihime](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/after-24-years-the-legendary-visual-novel-that-put-the-fatestay-night-devs-on-the-map-has-an-english-remake-and-its-out-reviewing-ff7-rebirth-hades-2-and-more/) and [Fate/stay Night](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/influential-visual-novel-finally-gets-official-english-release-after-20-years-and-fans-can-only-post-through-it-as-characters-and-backgrounds-straight-up-appear-in-the-wrong-scenes/) to [Kanon](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/after-25-years-one-of-the-og-anime-visual-novels-has-finally-hit-steam-with-its-first-official-english-translation/) and [Katawa Shoujo](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/after-12-years-legendary-visual-novel-katawa-shoujo-is-coming-to-steam-in-a-modified-sfw-version-for-those-who-want-it/) - the odds seem pretty good.
