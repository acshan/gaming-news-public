In another timeline, Blizzard may have its own version of [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s PC-dominating Steam store, but in our timeline it reportedly rejected a pitch back to expand its Battle.net launcher into a broader PC gaming storefront.

That's according to a new report from Bloomberg reporter and Blood, Sweat, and Pixels author Jason Schreier, who, in his new book [<u>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment</u>](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/?lens=grand-central-publishing) (as [<u>PC Gamer</u>](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/oof-years-before-steam-a-blizzard-engineer-wanted-to-turn-battle-net-into-a-third-party-game-store-but-was-reportedly-turned-down/) spotted), writes that former Blizzard programmer Patrick Wyatt proposed a plan "to turn Battle.net into a digital store for a variety of PC games" around 2000, three years before Valve released the Counter-Strike client that grew into the mega-store Steam is today. 

Mike O'Brien, who'd go on to join Wyatt and Jeff Strain to co-found Guild Wars studio ArenaNet after leaving Blizzard, apparently supported the pitch at the time, but the idea of a Battle.net store never made it past the company's upper management. You've got to wonder if someone in the company's C-suite was kicking themselves once again last year when Blizzard began bringing a selection of its games to Steam, now including Overwatch 2, Diablo 4, and the new Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred expansion. 

Schreier's book, citing interviews from some 350 current and former Blizzard employees, has turned up some surprising anecdotes, from [<u>canceled games like sci-fi Diablo and a Warcraft take on Helldivers</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/the-famous-blizzard-graveyard-of-canceled-games-includes-a-sci-fi-diablo-and-a-warcraft-take-on-helldivers/) to [<u>a short-lived Star Wars RTS concept that eventually became StarCraft</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/for-a-hot-minute-the-blizzard-game-that-morphed-into-starcraft-was-a-star-wars-rts-concept-that-went-nowhere/). 

*Believe it or not, Blizzard's in good company: *[<u><em>BioWare also "missed our big opportunity to be Steam" and sell The Witcher, with one dev saying "we’re kicking ourselves about it now."</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/bioware-missed-our-big-opportunity-to-be-steam-and-sell-the-witcher-were-kicking-ourselves-about-it-now/)
