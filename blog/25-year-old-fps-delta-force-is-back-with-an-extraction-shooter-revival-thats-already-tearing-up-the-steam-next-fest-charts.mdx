Delta Force, the tactical first-person shooter from 1998, is back and more explosive than ever, and it's one of the most popular [Steam Next Fest](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/steam-next-fest/) demos.

At the moment, developer Team Jade's Delta Force reboot is both the most-wishlisted Next Fest demo and the demo with the most active daily players. For FPS fans, it's easy to see why. Team Jade, an offshoot of Call of Duty: Mobile developer TiMi, seems to have created a chillingly realistic free-to-play military shooter with a bevy of engaging game modes.

Rather, soon-to-be engaging game modes. Team Jade promises in Delta Force's Steam description that the early access version of the game, which does not yet have a release date, will include an extraction mode and large-scale PvP.

Until then, the story goes like this: you're a Delta Force army operative, in either the year 1993 or 2035, and your job is to gun stuff down. The 1993 timeline is a recreation of the original Delta Force's Black Hawk Down sequel from 2003, which gets players dirty in the real-life Battle of Mogadishu, a disastrous fight with hundreds of casualties.

In Team Jade's version, Black Hawk Down exists in Unreal Engine. It renders Somalia's markets and rubble in steaming, excruciatingly vivid detail, and I imagine the pressure of this realistic environment is partly what keeps adrenaline-hunting players coming back to Delta Force during Next Fest.

"We're pushing Unreal Engine to its limits to deliver a truly cross-platform experience that allows players worldwide to immerse themselves in a vivid world of deep characters, explosive destruction, and top-notch action," game director Shadow Guo says in Delta Force's Steam description. "I hope this new Delta Force game will become the tactical FPS experience I dreamt of all those years ago."

Delta Force's demo is currently available to [download on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/).
