The Finals, Embark Studio's excellent FPS, has just entered its fifth season. As it celebrates its first birthday, we're here to tell you why you Season 5 is the best possible time to jump in if you haven't already.

First up, Season 5 makes The Finals bigger and better than it's ever been before. Each new season has brought new additions and improvements, and this is the best state the game's ever been in. New sponsors, new weapons, and new gadgets mean The Finals is more chaotic, inventive, and imaginative than ever before.

Next up, The Finals knows that any competitive game is best with friends, and Season 5 makes it easier than ever to play with your pals. The new Clubs feature makes it super simple to jump straight into the action with friends, and with extra XP and special progression paths, you've got no excuse not to bring a couple of allies along with you.

There are some fancy new changes in Season 5, but sometimes it's all about what you *can't *see. The devs have been busy tinkering all year, and in this new season, you've got improvements to older maps, tweaks to Ranked and Quick Cash game modes, and more Career Levels and Item Progression to unlock.

And that's before we get into the hardware - The Finals is now available on PS4 for those of you still fond of your last-gen machines. If you're a little more up to date, however, you'll be able to take advantage of the silky smooth 120Hz mode to improve your visuals on PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series X.

Last but not least is the real highlight of The Finals Season 5 - it's beautiful new map. Bernal is inspired by Mexico, which you'll see in its charming architecture and chaotic open squares, as well as the amazing mountain vistas that surround the arena.

Those are five reasons to check out The Finals with the start of its fifth season. But if that's somehow not quite enough, just remember that this is your best chance yet to catch up on one of the best FPS games out there. The Arena is calling - will you reply?
