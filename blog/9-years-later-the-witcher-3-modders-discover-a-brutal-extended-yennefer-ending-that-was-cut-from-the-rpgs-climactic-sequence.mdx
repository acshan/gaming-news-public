Nine years after The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt launched, its recently-released modding kit has allowed players to uncover a cut portion of its ending in which Yennefer actively causes the downfall of the Lodge of Sorceresses.

[The Witcher 3 Redkit ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3s-wildly-creative-official-modding-tools-release-for-free-later-this-month/)was made available in May, granting players full mod support over [CDPR](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/)'s sprawling RPG. It wasn't long before Redkit was being used to [create what might prove to be a pretty good early look at The Witcher Remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-3-modders-might-beat-the-witcher-remake-devs-to-the-punch-as-one-mod-ports-the-the-witcher-1s-biggest-city-into-the-latest-game/), but the tools have other uses too, like uncovering content cut from the very end of the game.

In a new video (via [PCGamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/modders-have-uncovered-an-extended-version-of-the-witcher-3s-ending-where-yennefer-pulls-off-a-shocking-betrayal-of-her-sorceress-friends/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=socialflow)), modders Glassfish and xLetalis outlined their discovery of unused files which they were able to reimplement in a debug mode of The Witcher 3. Those files differ from the final game, in which the fate of the Lodge of Sorceresses - an influential group of female magic users - is never really discussed. Geralt defeats Eredin and heads off to save Ciri from Avallac'h, while Sorcs don't really get a look in.

That wasn't always what was planned, however. The extended scene finds Geralt waking up post-boss fight in a Niflgaardian army medical tent before reconnecting with Yennefer, where he discovers that Ciri is missing. Several cutscenes play out, and there's a chance to speak with a number of characters as Geralt explores. The biggest change, however, is a section where you take Yennefer to the Lodge. The animation isn't complete, but it seems as though Geralt's goth gf sabotages a ritual that's taking place, allowing several high profile Sorceresses to be discovered - and later killed - by Nilfgaard.

The scene isn't entirely complete - no great surprise since it never made it to the full game - but it's surprisingly far along. Voice acting, player choice, and exploration all suggest that this was a pretty late cut, likely one intended to preserve the pace of the game's finale. I'm reminded of [The Last of Us 2's Lost Levels](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-lost-levels-offer-a-fascinating-peek-behind-the-gamedev-curtain/), which explained how [Naughty Dog](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/naughty-dog/) put sections of the game together, and why they eventually cut them from the game. Given the sheer size of The Witcher 3 (and just how little time RedKit has been available), I imagine we'll see plenty of similar discoveries - which should tide you over until [The Witcher 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-release-date/).
