[<u>Supervive</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/), the first game from new studio Theorycraft, seems just about ready to blow up. The atomic-bright hero shooter MOBA is currently sliding up [<u>Steam Next Fest</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/steam-next-fest/) charts and dominating Twitch. 

"The team has poured their hearts and souls into making the game as good as it can be for [Steam Next Fest](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/steam-next-fest/)," CEO Joe Tung — who was previously executive vice president of League of Legends at Riot — said in a statement posted [<u>to Discord</u>](https://x.com/playSUPERVIVE/status/1845254390858568137). Theorycraft's work seems to be paying off. At the time of writing, Supervive is the Next Fest demo with the second most daily active players, right under [<u>Delta Force</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/25-year-old-fps-delta-force-is-back-with-an-extraction-shooter-revival-thats-already-tearing-up-the-steam-next-fest-charts/). 

Supervive offers "a wild, open-ended combat sandbox," according to its Steam description, with multiple game modes, various flame-wielding hunters, and seemingly a metric ton of blinding lasers. Its development team includes many former staffers from games like LoL and Valorant, and so, even in its demo form, Supervive has the same high-intensity sheen as any AAA battle royale. 

That could be why, while Theorycraft held play sessions with streamers like loltyler1 this week, Supervive gathered [<u>nearly as many</u>](https://x.com/playSUPERVIVE/status/1846237351212995000) Twitch viewers as League of Legends — though its viewership has since dropped down to a more organic 18,000. 

In any case, Supervive seems to be in a strong position to rival the games its experienced developers used to work on. It does not yet have a release date, but its demo is live for 24 hours a day through the end of Next Fest.
