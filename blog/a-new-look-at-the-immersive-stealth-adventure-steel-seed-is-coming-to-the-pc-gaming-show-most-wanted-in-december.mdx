Steel Seed is getting a brand new gameplay reveal at the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase on December 6, 2024. The tantalizing tease was made during the Golden Joystick Awards, where developer Storm in a Teacup deployed a short, narrative-focused trailer to announce the news. 

I'm keen to see more of this stealth-action adventure in action. Through the likes of Close to the Sun and N.E.R.O.: Nothing Ever Remains Obscure, Storm in a Teacup has demonstrated a certain knack for building enticing worlds and narrative-driven experiences, and I'm expecting Steel Seed to deliver on that front. The game has had a good showing so far this year, with its beautiful dark sci-fi world and gameplay which mixes sharp traversal puzzles with more considered stealth-action combat. 

You don't need to take my word for it either. You can head [<u>over to the Steel Seed Steam page</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/) and give the game a try for yourself, with publisher ESDigital Games ensuring a hands-on preview demo is ready for any of you who are desperate to learn more. Steel Seed is currently scheduled to release in 2024 although a firm release date is yet to be set in stone – here's hoping that we learn more on that front soon, if not in the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted showcase in just a few short weeks time.
