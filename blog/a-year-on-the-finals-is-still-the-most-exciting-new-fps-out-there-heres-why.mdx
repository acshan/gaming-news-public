If you're looking for a new FPS experience that's a little different to the other games out there, look no further than The Finals. As Embark Studio's FPS celebrates its first anniversary with the start of its fifth season, it's firmly cemented itself as one of the most exciting challengers in the hugely competitive shooter genre.

An FPS from a suite of Battlefield veterans, The Finals was always going to live up to its reputation as an excellent shooter. Even so, it's managed to become a more frenzied, imaginative shooter than almost anything else out there right now, thanks to a combination of its innovative ranked mode and its eclectic arsenal of weapons and gadgets.

Are you a little bored of the classic rifles, SMGs, and grenades that have dominated years of multiplayer FPS games? What if I told you that in The Finals, you can run into battle with a spear or invisibility cloak? Or that you could keep your opponents off the objective by using an anti-gravity device to hoist their goal into the sky? Or that you could deal with the pesky enemy hiding behind a wall by simply deleting that wall from existence? The Finals lets you play however you like - and I mean *however*.

The Finals also does one thing better than almost any game out there, let alone any FPS. Its destruction tech is genuinely industry-leading, allowing every player to destroy pretty much anything on the map. Is there a wall in your way? Blow a hole in it. Is the enemy team hiding out inside a building? Pull out some explosives or a sledgehammer and bring that building down on top of them. Between that chaotic destruction and the suite of movement tools at your fingertips, The Finals lets you carve your own path, ensuring that every game feels like a whole new experience.

An amazing FPS at launch, The Finals has only gotten better. Season 5 brings a whole suite of new additions, improvements, and features. Weapons, gadgets, sponsors, and a whole new map are just the start - new progression systems, social Clubs, and the silky smooth new 120Hz mode, plus tweaks to older arenas and game modes means that this is the best version of an excellent FPS. And with Season 5 out now, you've got an excellent excuse to jump in and see what you've been missing out on.
