Violent video games don't create neck spasms and murderers the way [<u>so many people seem to assume</u>](https://www.404media.co/luigi-mangione-played-among-us-breathes-air/), but they are undeniably prevalent in the gaming industry. According to Fallout creator Tim Cain, there's an obvious reason for that.  

"If you look at, like, the [<u>Steam top 50</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed) or top 100 [most played games]," Cain says in a [new YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAbrZtmDQfM&ab_channel=TimothyCain) dissecting the topic of violent RPGs, "you see an awful lot of action, violent-oriented games. The companies don't make them because they *feel *like it. They make them because they sell." 

At the moment, Steam's 11th most played game - lodged between Call of Duty (guns) and War Thunder (tanks) - is the [free-to-play clicker game Banana](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/if-it-goes-viral-on-steam-itll-get-cloned-wildly-popular-banana-clicker-currently-beating-elden-ring-by-steam-players-spawns-apple-and-melon-competitors/), in which players click on a banana. But Cain emphasizes that pacifist games, whether they involve peelable fruit, flourishing gardens, or making Sims WooHoo in a coffin, are the exception, not the rule.   

"This is why I always tell people, 'vote with your dollars,'" Cain says. "If you think you're just a drop in the bucket - if enough people do this, those drops become a storm, and companies will listen." 

"It's just one of those things that, you have to draw the line somewhere, and everybody draws it in a different spot, and I get it," Cain continues. "You have a different financial situation, or you have a different situation about where you actually live and what is available to you. I get it. But to not draw a line because you think it won't matter is a way to guarantee it won't matter."
