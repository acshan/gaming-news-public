The Xbox 360 era came alongside the rise of indie gaming, and the Xbox Live Indie Game program helped give the smallest developers a much larger problem. Now, it seems a standout JRPG tribute called Breath of Death 7: The Beginning has stood the test of time well enough to earn its own remaster.

While the title 'Breath of Death 7' might suggest this is a late-era entry in some epic, long-running series, it's actually a standalone, comedy-minded tribute to 8-bit JRPGs. While somewhat bigger games got highlighted on Xbox Live Arcade, Breath of Death 7 was a standout among the smaller Xbox Live Indie Game titles, offering a Dragon Quest-style experience that you could wrap up in about six hours.

Breath of Death 7 was one of the top-rated XLIG titles up until the platform went defunct, and the game remains available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/107300/Breath_of_Death_VII/) to this day with "Very Positive" reviews. It's now bundled with developer

Zeboyd Digital Entertainment's follow-up, Cthulhu Saves the World, for $3 - or just $0.59 during the current Steam Autumn Sale.

Now another studio called Shadow Layer Games is set to launch Breath of Death 7: The Beginning Reanimated via [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3184210/Breath_of_Death_VII_The_Beginning_Reanimated/) on December 12. This version cheekily promises "new detailed visuals, animation, audio, and quality of undead updates," and the new graphics look quite nice - like a lost SNES JRPG we never got to play.

The best part? The devs have confirmed in a press release that just like the original, Reanimated is going to have an "amazing price point" - this time it's $5. Sure, that's a lot of inflation over the first game, but five bucks is still a more than fair asking price for a breezy JRPG in the classic style.
