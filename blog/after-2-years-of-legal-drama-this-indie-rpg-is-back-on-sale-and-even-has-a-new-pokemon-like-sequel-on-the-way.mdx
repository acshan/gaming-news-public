The Outbound Ghost, a turn-based RPG riffing on Paper Mario, has been haunted by a strange legal drama that left it delisted for almost two whole years. That curse has now been lifted, its legal troubles sorted, and there's even an all-new sequel on the way.

[The Outbound Ghost's removal from Steam and the Nintendo Switch eShop was so odd](https://www.gamesradar.com/indie-dev-hits-own-game-with-copyright-strike-in-protest-of-publishers-console-ports/) because its own indie developer Conradical Games is the party that issued a copyright strike. The developer's beef was against the game's publisher, Digerati, however. At the time, Conradical Games claimed that it had not "received a single dollar in royalties from the publisher," which was also allegedly "underreporting revenues" and refusing to fix unresolved issues in the console port - claims that Digerati refuted. The whole debacle left The Outbound Ghost in limbo, until now, that is.

"The lawsuit is over," Conradical Games [announced ](https://x.com/ConradicalGames/status/1847337069473054810)on social media. "The Outbound Ghost is back!" Alongside the original game's return to Steam and Switch - plus "new platforms coming soon" - the developer revealed that a sequel has quietly been in development, too.

The Outbound Ghost: Reborn runs with the first game's lovely paper art style and turn-based, timing-oriented combat, but also adds a Pokemon-ish twist to the formula "where the monsters you use are ghostly figments of your imagination." Best of all, the sequel will be "100% free for all Kickstarter backers and Steam players." And if you've been a fan of the cutesy 'n' spooky world, there's a "new game in the same universe called Soul Stalker" that's in [Steam early access](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714240/Soul_Stalker/) now, and is coming to all consoles on October 24.
