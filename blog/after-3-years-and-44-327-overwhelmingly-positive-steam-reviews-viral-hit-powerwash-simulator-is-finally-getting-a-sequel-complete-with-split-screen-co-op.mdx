PowerWash Simulator, the viral success about compulsively cleaning dirty surfaces with a pressure washer, is getting a very welcome sequel later this year.

Developer FuturLab today announced PowerWash Simulator 2, which boasts of soapier tools, new jobs and locations, a customizable homebase, split-screen co-op, and a whole new campaign that hopefully follows on from the first game's surprisingly bonkers, alien-involving, Atlantis-finding tale. (*No, I didn't wake up from a fever dream - PowerWash Sim actually has lore.*)

Unlike the first go around, [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) isn't on publishing duties anymore. PowerWash Simulator managed to reached 17 million players, so the studio is now self-publishing the follow-up.

That's not really a surprise when you consider the fact that PowerWash Simulator sponged up over 44,000 [Steam reviews](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/), 97% of which give it the thumbs up. One of the [best first-person squirter games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-fps-games/) ever? I wouldn't argue against it. And that's without mentioning the countless crossovers it managed to pull with juggernauts like Tomb Raider, Shrek, Wallace & Gromit, and even Warhammer.

As mentioned before, Powerwash Simulator 2 has an entire homebase for your business that you can decorate with trinkets you've collected or furniture that I assume you can buy with your job earnings. After many, many online requests, the sequel's also happily adding split-screen co-op in addition to online multiplayer options. And, borrowing a page from GTA 5's book, you can even invite your co-op pals to kick back in your, hopefully-pristinely clean, crib.

There's no release date for this one quite yet but PowerWash Simulator 2 will be jetting onto PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5 sometime in 2025.
