Rockstar has announced that [GTA 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5-guide/)'s PS5 and Xbox Series X patch is finally set to come to PC in 2025, bringing an end to years of requests from PC players.

The latest [GTA Online community update](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update) buried the bombshell in its final paragraph: "There is much more still to come, including ongoing weekly special events and bonuses, festive celebrations, gifts, surprises, as well as plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S features of GTA Online to the PC platform in the new year."

For PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, this patch launched back in March 2022, so it'll be near - or past - three years old by the time the update hits PC in 2025. Rockstar's historically had a habit of making PC players wait, but this one always felt especially egregious as the years went on, as what was once a "next-gen" patch had increasingly come to represent the current-gen standard.

Of course, GTA 5 on PC already looks very good, and nearly a match for the current-gen consoles even without the patch, but it's still missing a few visual features that were offered in the update. Most notably, there are ray-traced shadows and improved anti-aliasing options, and with those implemented the PC edition should retake its rightful place as the best-looking version of the game.

The other thing that GTA 5's been missing on PC this whole time is Hao's Special Works, a car shop with a number of unique customization and performance options. It's a small addition, but it should help make the wait for [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/) - which has only been announced for consoles - a little more bearable for PC players.
