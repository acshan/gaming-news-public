Where the developers for games like [<u>Black Myth: Wukong</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-guide/) and [<u>Phantom Blade Zero</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/phantom-blade-zero-is-not-a-soulslike-its-an-irresponsibly-fast-action-rpg-thats-somehow-become-one-of-my-summer-game-fest-favorites/) have come out and said they aren't making a Soulslike, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a loud-and-proud "Soulslike action RPG" set in a horror fiction take on the late Ming Dynasty. I got this vibe from [its reveal earlier this year](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/xbox-games-showcase-bethesda-live-coverage/), and the new trailer fresh from today's Xbox partner showcase seals the deal with phrenetic bosses and plentiful parries that are ringing my Sekiro alarms. 

There's thankfully a lot more gameplay this time. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is a third-person action game promising a distinctly darker take on the Chinese history and mythology that's (rather excitingly) becoming more prominent nowadays. Our hero, the female pirate Wuchang, is a one-woman army sporting dual swords, glaives, straight swords, magic clubs, magic flames, a spear gun, a flamethrower, a Sephiroth-esque blood wing, and a shotgun lightning bow. Let's not forget the feathered arm, either – evidently a sign of Wuchang's mixed bloodline. 

The sheer variety of weapons and attacks reminds me a bit of Nioh, and the Soulslike DNA shines brightest in the final third of the trailer, a chunk of which is dedicated to a single boss fight with a female avian warrior boss. Throughout the trailer, enemies and bosses stagger in the face of heavy attacks and recoil as Wuchang parries them away, though there's also a clear focus on dodging. In my 10 years of game journalism, I've played a lot of games like this and sat through a lot of their trailers, and so far I have a good feeling about this one. It all comes down to feel in the end, but Wuchang at least *looks* fast and responsive in combat. 

Wuchang: Fallen Feathers is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2025, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass day one. Here's hoping there's a demo or test opportunity before then. The [<u>Steam page is up</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/) now if you want to see more.
