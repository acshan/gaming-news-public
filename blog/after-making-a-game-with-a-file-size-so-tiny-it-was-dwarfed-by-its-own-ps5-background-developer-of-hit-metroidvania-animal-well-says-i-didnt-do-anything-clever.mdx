Breakout indie metroidvania Animal Well is one of the best games I've played so far this year. It's also by far the smallest, [clocking in at just 38MB](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/in-an-era-of-100gb-games-breakout-metroidvania-hit-animal-well-is-only-34mb-so-small-that-its-4k-ps5-background-is-likely-larger-than-the-game/), but its developer says they "didn't do anything particularly clever" to get the game down to that size,

In a recent AMA on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1cybe5t/we_are_billy_basso_and_dan_adelman_creator_of/), solo dev Billy Basso was asked whether he deliberately tried to keep the game's file size as small as possible, or whether that was simply a happy accident. Animal Well is, at its heart, a relatively simple 2D platformer, but in an era where game sizes have been ballooning, I don't remember coming across anything quite as small as this in a long time.

In response, Basso said that "I didn't do anything particularly clever" and that the game's tiny file size "was mostly just a side effect of using my own tools, not inheriting any of the bloat of another engine, and using actual low-resolution pixel art saves like 99 percent of the space a game would typically need."

I imagine there are some other tricks going - repeating but cleverly used visual assets, for one thing - but in just those two tricks, Basso outlines a couple of things that aren't exactly common practice. A huge number of games are made in major engines like Unity or Unreal, which aren't exactly hyper-specific, and cause inadvertent bloat. And at a time when visual fidelity is held in such high regard, it's rare to see low-res art *actually* be low-res, rather than being stored in a far more intensive file format. File size aside, Animal Well remains an indie gem of 2024, but it certainly doesn't hurt that it'll take you a matter of seconds to install and try out for yourself.
