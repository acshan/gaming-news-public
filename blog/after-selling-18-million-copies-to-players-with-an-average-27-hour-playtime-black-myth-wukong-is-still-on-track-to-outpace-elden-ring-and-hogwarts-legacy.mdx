Black Myth: Wukong continues to outpace the biggest of big games, as 18 million people have played the Monkey King action game for an estimated 27 hours each.

Black Myth: Wukong was already outperforming the likes of Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy to become ["one of the fastest-selling games of all time."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-is-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-of-all-time-beating-elden-ring-and-hogwarts-legacy-with-10-million-copies-sold-in-just-4-days/) It had sold a whopping 10 million copies in just four days at that point. Now, two weeks in, Game Science's Chinese mythology RPG has sold another eight million copies, according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?leadSource=uverify%20wall).

What's more impressive is Black Myth: Wukong's player retention. Those 18 million played the game for an estimated average of over 27 hours, according to estimates from VG Insights down below - and [Black Myth Wukong takes around 25 hours to complete](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-how-long-time-to-beat-length/), meaning most players are sticking through the tough-as-nail boss rush.

Update - Black Myth: Wukong has now sold an estimated 17 million units.https://t.co/9dFU5Gmiuq pic.twitter.com/1PxyIZBSyO[September 2, 2024](https://twitter.com/VG_Insights/status/1830606357491552558)

Analyst Daniel Ahmad later reiterated in a [tweet ](https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831660410451243077)that Black Myth: Wukong is "one of the fastest selling games of all time," after having made "around $800 million now," only behind even more colossal hits like GTA 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which are both from widely known and established series.

Black Myth: Wukong first went viral worldwide years ago, but we won't need to wait quite as long for a follow-up from Game Science. The studio isn't working on a sequel just yet - Bloomberg also reports that it's instead hammering away at an expansion to Black Myth: Wukong, so it can get another Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree-esque second wind. Maybe it'll coincide with the Xbox port, which is currently stuck in a [weird exclusivity knot](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/xbox-woes-abound-as-the-black-myth-wukong-situation-gets-weirder-indies-get-frustrated-over-lack-of-communication-and-series-s-continues-offering-a-challenge-to-devs/).
