There may not be any new [<u>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-guide/) updates coming from [<u>Nintendo</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/), but the community certainly isn't dead - and it's recently caught wind of what looks to be a pretty close copy of the beloved 2020 life sim.

Anime Life Sim isn't at all what it sounds like. It's not an anime-themed game featuring some fan-favorite protagonists or settings, but rather a series of ideas drawn substantially from Animal Crossing - from the gameplay detailed on its [<u>PlayStation Store</u>](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013841) page to the colorful visuals, Anime Life Sim screams New Horizons through and through. It features no mention of Nintendo's own title, however.

"Create your perfect anime life in this charming social simulation," reads the eerily similar project's description. "Build your dream home, befriend quirky animal neighbors, and live out endless adventures in a vibrant world inspired by your favorite life sims." In other words, it plays like New Horizons as much as it looks like it - it's all about bug catching, building, crafting, collecting, fishing, and befriending animal-esque villagers.

Anime Life Sim also isn't the first controversial title to come from developer and publisher Maksym Vysochanskyy, who trades under the alias "IndieGames3000." Just two months ago, eagle-eyed Monster Hunter fans spotted a suspicious game on the PlayStation Store dubbed "Monster Hunters." A [<u>post</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gum9x1/theyre_not_even_trying_to_hide_it_being_a_ripoff/) on Reddit highlights the now-removed Monster Hunters and its clear similarities to [<u>Capcom</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/)'s legitimate, long-standing series.

Upon browsing through Vysochanskyy's library of releases on [<u>PS Deals</u>](https://psdeals.net/us-store/all-games?publisher=Maksym+Vysochanskyy+trading+as+IndieGames3000), it becomes obvious that pretty much every single game operating under his name is a near-identical clone of another title.

It's all questionable, to say the least. Anime Life Sim likely won't come to fruition and launch in 2026 as it's supposedly meant to, however, judging by the fate of Monster Hunters. After all, it's not as though Nintendo takes such situations lightly. [<u>Palworld</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/palworld-guide/) and the [<u>lawsuit</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/its-official-palworld-has-been-nintendod-as-the-pokemon-company-files-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-for-infringing-multiple-patent-rights/) filed against its developer Pocketpair for infringing "multiple patent rights" prove as much - and Palworld is arguably much tamer in comparison when considering similarities.
