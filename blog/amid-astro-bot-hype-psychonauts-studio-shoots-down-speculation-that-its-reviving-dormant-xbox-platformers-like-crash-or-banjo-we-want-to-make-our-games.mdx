Astro Bot might be all the rage right now, but Psychonauts 2 developer Double Fine has reiterated that it still isn't working on something related to corporate owner Xbox's now-massive slate of dormant platformers.

"We love platformers here at Double Fine, so imagine our smiles playing Astro Bot and seeing what ~seems~ to be a familiar face," the studio tweeted yesterday. "In 2013, we collaborated with Japan Studios on the Playroom's 'My Alien Buddy' and it seems like a version of our green friend is still on a rampage."

For those not neck-deep in Astro Bot lore, the little guy was first assembled for free PS4 minigame marathon The Playroom, made by the now shut-down Japan Studios, and one of the DLC packs featuring a bobbly green alien came courtesy of Double Fine. A very similar-looking, UFO-riding green alien serves as the main antagonist of this year's Astro Bot.

"Coincidence? I don't believe in 'em, Scully! But either way we're always happy to see another game with a double jump," the studio continues. "Congrats to Team Asobi on the fun times!"

If I were a snob I'd point out that Astro Bot doesn't actually have a double jump, but people were excited at the prospect of more platformers regardless since [Astro's one of the most widely-loved games this year](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/playstation-platformer-astro-bot-dethrones-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-as-the-highest-rated-game-of-2024-so-far/).

In the comments, one fan asks about the possibility of Double Fine reviving Banjo-Kazooie, the classic platformer that's largely been dormant for almost 20 years. "No," is the studio's simple answer. Another fan instead tests their luck to ask about "Conker?" - the similarly great but dormant platformer about the worst hangover a bad-mouthed squirrel could ever have. 

"No," the studio [says ](https://x.com/DoubleFine/status/1832249076643188758)again. "We want to make our games." That's a sentiment that studio founder Tim Schafer expressed around Psychonauts 2's launch, and thankfully nothing's changed for the team since. More recently, Double Fine also hinted that it was making [several oddball games that "could never be accepted at a publisher,"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/double-fine-is-making-several-weird-games-that-could-never-get-accepted-by-a-publisher-though-some-developers-leave-the-door-open-for-psychonauts-3/) although a couple of developers left the door open for an eventual Psychonauts 3. 

For anyone still desperately hoping for the bird and bear's comeback, [Phil Spencer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/phil-spencer/) did recently make some vague promises about reviving cult favorites: ["Banjo fans, I hear you."](https://www.gamesradar.com/phil-spencer-says-xbox-game-pass-has-made-small-games-and-retro-revivals-more-viable-banjo-fans-i-hear-you/) And despite [the cancellation of Crash Bandicoot 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/crash-bandicoot/activision-reportedly-canceled-a-crash-bandicoot-5-that-also-starred-spyro-because-it-wanted-more-live-service-games/) (featuring Spyro), developer [Toys For Bob has also signed a deal to work on a new platformer with Xbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/crash-bandicoot-spyro-and-skylanders-developer-is-reportedly-making-a-game-with-former-owner-xbox-shortly-after-going-indie/).
