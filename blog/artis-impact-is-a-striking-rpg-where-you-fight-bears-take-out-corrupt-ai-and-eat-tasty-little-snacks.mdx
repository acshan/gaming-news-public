There's something really alluring about Artis Impact, an upcoming RPG created by a solo Malaysian developer, Mas, that just got revealed at the [Future Games Show Spring Showcase](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/).

You play as Arkane, who's accompanied by Bot, as they attempt to unravel various mysteries in a post-apocalyptic world that's threatened by hostile AI.

The pixel-art RPG is hand-drawn and makes for quite the compelling visual treat. I'm already loving the amount of little details that I've seen in the demo that's available to play on Steam right now.

You'll experience various elements of Arkane's life, from diving into dungeons to eating dinner in your fully customizable home. There's turn-based combat too, with training to let you upgrade Arkane's weapons and abilities in order to be better equipped to take down the rogue and deadly AI.

Even from the demo alone, it's clear that there's some excellent writing here, with plenty of wit alongside the main storyline. Developer Mas promises that there's plenty to discover here, with the nosiest players rewarded for how much they want to explore. I love the fact that it seems to be as much about combat here as it is taking five to make some food or relax at home.

Artis Impact aims to release on PC, but you can get a taste of what's to come with the Steam demo that's available right now.
