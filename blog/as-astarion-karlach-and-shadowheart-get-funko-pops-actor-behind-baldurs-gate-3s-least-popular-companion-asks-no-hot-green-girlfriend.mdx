Funko just revealed collectible figurines of several Baldur's Gate 3 characters, but not the sour-faced Githyanki warrior Lae'zel, prompting her voice actress Devora Wilde [<u>to ask</u>](https://x.com/Devora_Wilde/status/1846731707006754969) "No Lae’zel? No hot green girlfriend?"

"Boycotting until they make a green girlfriend," agreed [<u>one reply</u>](https://x.com/icarriancarion/status/1846733585618735521) to Wilde's post on X. 

As of now, the BG3 Funko Pop collection includes the Tiefling barbarian Karlach, who comes with her trusty axe and teddy bear [<u>Clive</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/15phgjg/just_found_out_that_karlach_has_a_teddy_bear/), the devoted half-elf Shadowheart, and two versions of the brazen vampire spawn Astarion. One version features Astarion with his eyebrows arched as he holds a dagger, and the other features Astarion with his eyebrows arched as he holds the Necromancy of Thay spellbook. 

"I need Astarion wiped off the face of the universe," decided one post [<u>on X</u>](https://x.com/Jbandos/status/1846875940883710177). Among fans, the consensus seems to be that not one, but *two* smug Astarion Funkos are too much to bear when there are no figurines of the pea-colored but very confident Lae'zel or the handsome warlock Wyll. 

"No Wyll? No Lae'zel? Then no money!" [<u>one fan</u>](https://x.com/cannabisbutch/status/1846890433072202173) announced. 

According to BG3 developer Larian's [<u>2023 statistics</u>](https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-23-here-s-to-you_83), Astarion, Karlach, and Shadowheart are some of the most in-demand Origin characters players can select during character creation, and Lae'zel is the least chosen. Though, broad-shouldered wizard Gale is picked more than any other companion, and he hasn't been compacted into a Funko Pop either. Maybe it isn't personal. 

Funko sometimes adds more Pops to a franchise's batch, too, so not all hope is lost for an angry Githyanki you could leave on your nightstand. If not, though — green girlfriends deserve more than a quiet life as a Funko Pop, anyway.
