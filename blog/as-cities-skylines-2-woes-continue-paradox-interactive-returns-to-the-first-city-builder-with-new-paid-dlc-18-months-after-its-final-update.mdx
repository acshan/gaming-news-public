As [Paradox Interactive](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/paradox-interactive/) reels from the troublesome launch of [Cities: Skylines 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/cities-skylines-2-tips-strategy/), the company is returning to the first game in the series, which it had apparently moved on from more than a year ago, with paid DLC.

Last May, 18 months ago for those counting, Paradox Interactive seemed to have closed the door on Cities: Skylines' long roadmap with what was supposed to have been the city builder's very last major update and mini-expansion. At the time, the company said it was shifting its focus to Cities: Skylines 2, but that plan hasn't gone so smoothly. 

The much-hyped sequel launched with [technical woes so glaring that they overshadowed basically everything else](https://www.gamesradar.com/cities-skylines-2-review/) in the simulation. Months of patches and fixes haven't completely cured all of Cities: Skylines 2's ailments, though, as its [first DLC was also struck with similar problems](https://www.gamesradar.com/cities-skylines-2s-first-dlc-went-down-so-badly-its-free-now-and-the-city-builder-devs-have-delayed-the-next-expansion-to-focus-on-fixing-everything-else/) and was eventually made free due to fan backlash. More recently, developer Colossal Order [delayed all of the sequel's planned DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/city-builder/a-year-later-barely-any-of-cities-skylines-2s-first-year-dlc-has-actually-launched-and-now-its-all-been-delayed-again/) - some packs were pushed more than a year passed their original release windows - to work on the game's more pressing issues first.

On the heels of all that drama, Paradox Interactive is now going back to its most sure fire hit. Cities: Skylines (The First) just received three new paid DLC packs themed around the great outdoors. The Mountain Village Pack and Map Pack 3 both focus on "mountain peaks and alpine terrain," while Radio Station Alpine Tunes brings new songs into the fold.

"We also want to reassure those of you that play Cities: Skylines 2, that the development of this new content for Cities: Skylines is an entirely separate effort," the publisher explained in its announcement [blog](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651?l=english). "The content you’ll find in this release for Cities: Skylines has been implemented by Tantalus, the studio who managed the console ports for Cities: Skylines. No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines 2 for this - our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines 2. This approach allows us to release some updates without compromising on either game."
