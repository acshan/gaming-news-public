[Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/) made its big re-debut a few months ago, promising a fall 2024 launch without any specific release date. It seems we won't have to wait much longer before marking our calendars, as [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) says a full release date reveal is coming in August.

In a new [blog post](https://blog.bioware.com/2024/07/31/unveiling-the-veilguard-cast-and-characters-detailed-at-san-diego-comic-con/), BioWare details the recent appearance of the [Dragon Age](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/dragon-age/): The Veilguard cast at San Diego Comic-Con. But what's really piqued fans' interest is this line at the end of the post: "We’ll have more to share next month – including a new roadmap, more looks at the game, and our official release date (!)"

This post comes on July 31, so 'next month' is coming *very* soon, and it looks like BioWare has some major reveals in store. If you're worried about this late release date announcement indicating a delay out of the previously announced fall 2024 window, take heart - publisher EA reiterated that The Veilguard is coming out in the autumn as part of a [financial report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2025/q1/Q1-FY25-Prepared-Remarks-FINAL.pdf) published just yesterday.

The curious part is the "roadmap" mentioned in the post. Could that be a DLC roadmap, or perhaps a marketing roadmap similar to the [one the devs published](https://x.com/dragonage/status/1799880494982807769) ahead of all the big June reveals? My money's on the latter, but August starts in a matter of hours as I write this, so I guess we won't have to wait too long before finding out.
