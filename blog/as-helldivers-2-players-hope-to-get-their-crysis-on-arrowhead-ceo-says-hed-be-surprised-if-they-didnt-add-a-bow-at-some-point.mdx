> Helldivers 2's developer hints at a future bow and arrow weapon, a highly requested feature echoing a popular Crysis weapon, despite no current plans for a Crysis crossover.

A [<u>Helldivers 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) Crysis crossover is one of the more persistent requests in the co-op shooter's community, and while that may never come to fruition, the next best thing just might.

For some context, the Predator Bow is an incredibly popular weapon in the 2013 first-person shooter Crysis 3, and there's been a lot of demand for a Crysis crossover in Helldivers 2. Tonally, it makes sense, they're both futuristic sci-fi shooters with hostile aliens, and with [Crysis 4 finally in development](https://www.gamesradar.com/crysis-4-has-been-announced/) after such a long wait, it would be pretty timely.

Anyway, nothing like that has been announced or even teased just yet, but it sure as heck sounds like a bow and arrow in Helldivers 2 is a very real possibility, which would pretty much be the next best thing. In a Discord Q&A, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani said he'd be surprised if Helldivers 2 never added a bow and arrow as a weapon.

"I haven't seen any plans for a bow afaik," Jorjani said. "But I'd be surprised if we didn't see one AT SOME POINT."

The capitalized "AT SOME POINT" definitely implies there aren't any current plans for a bow and probably won't be for a while, but hey, that's the boss of the Helldivers 2 studio saying it'll likely eventually happen. That's worth something, I reckon.
