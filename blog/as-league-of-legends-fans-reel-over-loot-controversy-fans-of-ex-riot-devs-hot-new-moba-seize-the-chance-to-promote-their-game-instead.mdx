After the controversial decision to stop rewarding you with Hextech chests so you can unlock free [<u>League of Legends</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/league-legends-tips-and-tricks-riot-games/) skins, fans of [<u>Supervive</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battle-royale/ive-got-high-hopes-for-this-league-of-legends-and-overwatch-fueled-steam-next-fest-hit-but-im-worried-history-will-repeat-itself/), a game made by ex-Riot devs, are telling people to play it instead.

Andrei "Meddler" van Roon and Paul "Pabro" Bellezza [<u>explain</u>](https://x.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/1887894090555003034) why the choice was made in a dev update, but it still hasn't gone over well with fans.

Meddler says Hexchests, which were part of a system that rewarded good plays and nice behavior with components you could use to unlock skins, were "A great player experience, but it was not sustainable for League in the long term."

Pabro adds, "Increasing the number of skins we can make each year was good for both the business and the player experience, but eventually we ran into meaningful diminishing returns."

So, the decision was made to remove Hextech chests entirely, meaning you have to spend money if you want new skins. This has been done to "ensure League remains a great, fully free-to-play game," but it's irritating nonetheless.

"Just wanted to mention how some of the best Rioters ever got tired of the company and left to make a superior game with a friendly monetization system and unique gameplay," writes [<u>one fan</u>](https://x.com/thornynobby/status/1888324597742743837) of Supervive in a quote tweet response to the dev update. "With league imploding, Supervive is worth your consideration! Give it a shot," [<u>writes another</u>](https://x.com/KyleXCVI/status/1888298751070253203), sharing a video of a new Supervive patch that went live the day after League's dev update.

Supervive is a "MOBA battle royale meets hero shooter" that launched in November, 2024. However, despite this "play Supervive" campaign, its player count hasn't gone up by that much these past few days.

According to SteamDB, since February 7, where the concurrent player count was 2,921, it rose to a height of 3,875 on February 10. It's a respectable increase, but the game had just over 4,000 players on January 26.

The player count is fairly steady, consistently over 2,000, so if you do want to give it a go, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a match. It's a free-to-play early access game that you can [<u>download from Steam</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1283700/SUPERVIVE/).
