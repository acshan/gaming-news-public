When you stop to think about it, Pikmin's brand of minion-throwing strategy lends itself quite nicely to games about power dynamics. [Overlord](https://www.gamesradar.com/overlord-review/) had you cosplay as an unstoppable evil boss who uses pesky goblin critters to do his bidding, for example, but one new [indie game](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/indie-game/) reverses the trope.

Inspired by Pikmin, Labor Power is the free, browser-based, pixel art strategy game about unionizing an entire office. One day, your character decides he doesn't want want to wait another 45 years to reach retirement age - he wants to feel human again now. So, off you go to pull co-workers away from their desk and storm the office floors until you reach the main boss, The Devil, capitalism personified. 

In case you haven't seen it, I made a Pikmin-inspired game about organizing a strike at a workplace. pic.twitter.com/dythILE6z1[June 2, 2024](https://twitter.com/FeatureKreep/status/1797312683420553277)

The Pikminishness comes in with blocks/doors that can't be moved/unlocked without the right number of co-workers, and you can also fling them at security guards for a quick stun.

Labor Power's [Itch.io](https://featurekreep.itch.io/labor-power) description calls it a game "dedicated to class solidarity and the betterment of working conditions," since you can't beat the game or "organize a strike all on your own." Developer Feature Kreep first came up with the concept in a 2024 Game Jame where the theme was "Power," before fleshing it out into the roughly 15-minute mini-strategy game you see today.

A game about unionizing is particularly relevant today as, y'know, a record number of video game developers have been subject to [mass layoffs](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/ign-owner-reportedly-closes-humble-games-publisher-of-wildly-popular-indie-games-like-coral-island-unpacking-signalis-and-forager/) and [studio closures](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/microsoft-reportedly-closing-the-bethesda-studios-behind-redfall-hi-fi-rush-and-more-following-reprioritization-of-titles-and-resources/) this year, with Destiny developer [Bungie laying off another 220 employees](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/destiny/destiny-devs-blindsided-after-another-220-inexcusable-layoffs-are-announced-publicly-this-is-how-ive-found-out-im-laid-off/) just yesterday. 

Many teams have instead taken the Labor Power route - not by chucking co-workers at middle management - but by unionizing. Days after [Bethesda Game Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bethesda-game-studios/) staff organized to form a massive "wall-to-wall," cross-department union, [500 World of Warcraft developers joined](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/world-of-warcraft/days-after-losing-a-friendly-race-to-bethesda-staff-over-500-world-of-warcraft-devs-unionize-at-blizzard-never-happier-to-be-outrun/) the growing list of unionized game staff.
