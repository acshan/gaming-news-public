Pre-order bonuses nowadays aren't quite as aggressive as they used to be - anyone remember[ the silly Deus Ex: Mankind Divided tiers](https://www.gamesradar.com/deus-ex-mankind-divided-augment-pre-order-canceled/)? - but everything from exclusive cosmetics to early access entry are still used to lure excited players into buying the game before release. So, the [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) team has had to remind folks once again that, yes, the upcoming beta is really, really free.

[Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) had already announced that its upcoming [Monster Hunter Wilds beta](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-how-to-access/) wouldn't be paywalled behind pre-orders, but it seems like not enough people got the memo, and I wouldn't blame them since even the likes of this year's Concord and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had betas exclusively for pre-orderers.

"Hunters, we've seen some comments wondering if you need to have pre-ordered Monster Hunter Wilds to access the Open Beta Test," the game's social media account [tweeted](https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1849496460540178934). "The answer is no, no pre-order is needed to play! However, if you'd like to pre-order after playing the Open Beta Test, that'd be cool!" Probably the most polite pre-order request I've ever seen. 

That open beta will be available to everyone on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC starting from October 31 until November 3 - check out the [full details here](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-starts-next-week-with-crossplay-across-all-platforms-but-ps5-players-can-get-in-early-through-ps-plus/) - and PlayStation Plus subscribers get to enjoy the test a little early on PS5 as the beta will go live tomorrow on October 28 at 8pm PT / October 29 at 3am GMT.

If you'd like to pre-order the big-beast-basher anyway, Capcom has thrown some goodies into the mix. None of the extras are, ahem, wild enough to place among [the most baffling pre-order bonuses ever](https://www.gamesradar.com/10-shockingly-awful-pre-order-bonuses/), but an exclusive armor cosmetic and an in-game talisman are nice enough.
