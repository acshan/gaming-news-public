It seems that Larian Studios isn't afraid to openly disapprove of [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) scalpers, with publishing director Michael Douse calling them out online.

As seen in a recent eye-watering screenshot [<u>posted</u>](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1845053997410914579) by the lead, copies of the RPG's limited Collector's Edition are going for thousands on websites like eBay. "Hate scalpers, man," writes Douse, condemning the scalpers' overpriced listings. "I understand how commodity works, but this CE isn't a commodity it's designed to make someone happy, not rich. If you're buying it to trade, all you're doing is making someone sad."

While it's a sad sight to behold, especially as a dedicated fan of Baldur's Gate 3 myself, it's unfortunately not all that surprising - after all, copies of the Collector's Edition were being [resold for over $1,000](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-collectors-editions-are-being-resold-for-over-dollar1000/) back in 2023. That's a far throw from Larian's original price for the limited edition at just $269.99. Baldur's Gate 3 isn't the only product in gaming affected by greedy online scalpers recently, either.
