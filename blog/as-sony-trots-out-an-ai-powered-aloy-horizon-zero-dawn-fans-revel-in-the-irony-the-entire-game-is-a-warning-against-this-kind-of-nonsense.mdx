The [<u>Horizon Zero Dawn</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tips/) series serves as a warning against the careless use of AI and the pursuit of technical improvement at the cost of all else. That's why fans of the games find it very ironic [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) used protagonist Aloy to show off its new [<u>AI-powered character prototypes</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-aloy-is-the-star-of-sonys-leaked-ai-powered-character-prototype-which-allows-users-to-ask-questions-to-an-unsettling-emotionless-version-of-the-protagonist/). Spoilers ahead.

"The entire game is a warning against this kind of nonsense," [<u>writes</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1j8hzz9/comment/mh5g97v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) one fan on Reddit. "The irony of this .... hits so hard," [<u>replies</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1j8hzz9/comment/mh5hu6z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) another. In the original Horizon Zero Dawn, you find out the world was destroyed by a rogue AI that creates self-replicating robots that feed on organic matter. Now, I'm not saying that's what Sony's AI-powered Aloy is, but it certainly seems strange that the company is investing time and money into something very few players actually seem to want.

One [<u>Redditor</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1j8hzz9/comment/mh5lv3i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) notes, "The point [of Horizon] is not 'AI is bad,'" it's that misusing AI is bad. I like the idea of AI ordering my shopping for me and finding me a cheaper energy or internet provider, but I think replacing artists with algorithms is not good.

"Oh cool, the main character from hit game 'donâ€™t replace humans with AI' is now replacing the cast with AI. I love it here," [<u>writes</u>](https://x.com/ThatBoyAqua/status/1899912574835319232) one person on Twitter. Another Redditor [<u>claims</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1j8hzz9/comment/mh5sfot/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), "The point is that billionaires are dumb." Now, I'm not calling anyone dumb, but it does seem like it's mostly rich tech CEOs who are pushing AI on everyone else.

I wonder what Aloy would think of an AI version of herself. She's already a clone, so maybe she'd find it comforting. It'd be an interesting thing to dive into in a sequel to [<u>Horizon Forbidden West</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/horizon-forbidden-west-guide/).
