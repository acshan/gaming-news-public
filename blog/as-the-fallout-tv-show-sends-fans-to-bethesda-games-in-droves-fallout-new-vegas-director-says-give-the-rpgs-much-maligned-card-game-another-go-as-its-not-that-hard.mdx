Following the success of the [<u>Fallout TV show</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-tv-show-season-one-amazon-prime-video-release-date-cast-trailer-story-setting-guide/), the director of Fallout New Vegas is encouraging fans to give its much-maligned card game another try. 

Earlier this week, Josh Sawyer, who worked as project director and lead designer on Fallout: New Vegas, replied to a Twitter user who was poking fun at the game's card game, Caravan. If you didn't know, the mini-game can be found in New Vegas' Mojave Wasteland but isn't a lot of players' first choice for things to do in the RPG.

Replying to the tweet, which basically suggests a lot of people still don't understand Caravan even 14 years later, Sawyer said: "It's more complicated than Samuel's Lansquenet but not that hard [in my opinion]" - referring to a card game in the developer's more recent game [<u>Pentiment</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/pentiment-review/). 

it's more complicated than Samuel's Lansquenet but not that hard imo https://t.co/1X4mNGr7Mn[April 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/jesawyer/status/1779724093396508881)

In response, another Twitter user replied: "Josh, less than 6% of PC players have the 'Win 3 games of Caravan' achievement."  The numbers clearly don't lie, but Sawyer wasn't ready to admit defeat, and continued to defend Caravan by suggesting that "they should try again [in my opinion]." So if you've been influenced to return to Fallout New Vegas - maybe [after watching the Fallout TV show](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-games-surge-in-popularity-as-the-amazon-prime-tv-show-proves-a-hit-with-fans-old-and-new/) - you should give Caravan another go. 

they should try again imo https://t.co/8eIgmhTwau[April 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/jesawyer/status/1779726352079634889)

Despite the Fallout TV show's popularity, this hasn't prompted any movement in terms of new games. Just days after the series premiered, a [Bethesda veteran implied that we shouldn't Fallout 5 any time soon](https://www.gamesradar.com/despite-the-fallout-tv-shows-success-bethesda-veteran-says-not-to-expect-fallout-5-any-time-soon-we-need-time-to-make-great-stuff/) as "we need time to make great stuff." It's not all bad news though, as we are getting the [Fallout 4 next-gen update](https://www.gamesradar.com/nearly-a-decade-later-fallout-4-is-getting-its-next-gen-update-with-60-fps-support-and-a-pile-of-new-content-just-in-time-for-the-tv-show/) which adds 60fps support, a new quest, and more on April 25.
