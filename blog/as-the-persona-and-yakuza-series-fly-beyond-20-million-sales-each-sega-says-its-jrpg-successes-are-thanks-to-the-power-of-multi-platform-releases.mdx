The [<u>Persona</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona/) series has now reached over 23 million players worldwide and Yakuza almost 28 million - and [<u>Sega</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sega/) says that this fast-growing success can be attributed to a few key choices regarding games' releases.

According to [Sega](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sega/)â€™s [<u>Annual Integrated Report for 2024</u>](https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/ja/ir/ir_2024_web_all_jp.pdf), both the Persona and Like a Dragon franchises are flying. The former series boasts 23.5 million copies sold while the latter has hit a whopping 27.7 million sales worldwide. These impressive figures include digital and physical sales, with the Persona 5 line of games and spin-off titles accounting for over 10 million copies sold alone - [<u>almost half of the series' lifetime sales</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-5-makes-up-almost-half-of-the-series-lifetime-sales/).

The JRPGs' success, as Sega describes it, comes for a few reasons - with the first being the publisher's multi-platform approach to launches. It also comes down to simultaneous worldwide releases, with statements from one of last year's quarterly reports highlighting plans for future titles like [<u>Persona 6 to drop across multiple platforms globally on day one</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-6-looks-set-to-release-across-multiple-platforms-on-day-one/). Sega cites remasters and spin-offs as factors for sales growth, too, with recent examples like [<u>Persona 3 Reload</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/persona-3-reload/).

Earlier this year, the remaster of the beloved 2006 entry was released following the very standards Sega says are responsible for high sales - Persona 3 Reload launched across all systems worldwide at once on February 2. It certainly seems to be working for the company, and as a longtime fan of JRPG series like Persona and action-adventure gems such as Like a Dragon, I'm happy not to have to wait for any delayed global releases.
