Larian Studios' [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) publishing director Michael 'Cromwelp' Douse is calling out [<u>Ubisoft</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) for its subscription-based approach to games following the company's changes to the team behind [<u>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/).

Following [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s recent decision to disband the team behind Prince of Persia Metroidvania entry The Lost Crown in favor of [<u>transferring them on to games with better sales potential</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/the-team-behind-the-excellent-prince-of-persia-metroidvania-has-reportedly-been-disbanded-because-ubisoft-wants-those-devs-on-games-with-better-sales-potential/), Douse explains why he believes the company's subscription-based strategy is "broken" in a lengthy [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147473354211400). "The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021," writes the Larian lead, going on to address why there should've been a Steam release for The Lost Crown.

"The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn't perform," he continues, "so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn't be launching their store all too much." Had the game dropped on [<u>Valve</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s platform, Douse thinks things might be different. "If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong."

The director calls Ubisoft's approach "such a broken strategy." He continues: "The hardest thing is to make a 85+ game - it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn't be done as it was." In a follow-up [post](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147977144606908), Douse also goes on to make a very good point - if a company wants to stand behind its subscription-based model, then it should come as no surprise when sales don't work out the way that they could've if a game had launched normally.

"If the statement 'gamers should get used to not owning their games' is true because of a specific release strategy (sub above sales)," he says, "then the statement 'developers must get used to not having jobs if they make a critically acclaimed game' (platform strategy above title sales) is also true, and that just isn't sensible - even from a business perspective." While I'm not a dev myself, I am a frequent purchaser of games - and I certainly agree.
