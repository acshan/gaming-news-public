As the spring [<u>Steam sale</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/steam-sale-guide/) carries on with [<u>Undertale selling for just $1</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-deltarune-chapter-3-and-4-seem-closer-than-ever-toby-foxs-unforgettable-rpg-undertale-is-just-usd1-in-the-steam-spring-sale-2025-and-everyone-should-play-it/), solo developer Toby Fox shares that the 2015 RPG has just hit a major milestone 10 years after its release – a new peak player count.

Revealing the impressive new peak in a recent [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1901049377134907874), Fox celebrates the fresh influx of players and hints that the unmissable $1 sale still has "a few more days" to go now. "Since going on sale on Steam for only $1," writes the dev, "Undertale reached a new peak of concurrent players for the first time since 2015!" Attached is a screenshot showcasing 10,739 players as the new all-time peak for Undertale – and what's more, this number actually grew, too.

The [<u>current all-time peak</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/391540/charts/) was hit yesterday and stands at a whopping 11,071 players, a whole 332 more than when Fox posted just two days ago. It could go up, too – as Fox himself says, "It's still on sale for a few more days" – so there's plenty of time for even more new fans to hop into the 2015 gem. As for the old record almost a decade ago, it stood at 10,473 players, which is an entire 598 users below yesterday's exciting peak.

There's no better time than now to experience Undertale if you already haven't – after all, Fox is currently wrapping up Chapters 3 and 4 of Deltarune, which has been in the works for [<u>over six years</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/6-years-after-deltarunes-initial-launch-toby-fox-says-the-rpgs-next-2-chapters-will-100-percent-come-out-in-2025/) now, with [<u>testing on PlayStation 5</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/undertales-toby-fox-seemingly-confirms-deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-drawing-near-with-console-tests-and-updates-underway-tomorrow-we-start-testing-playstation-5/) recently commencing and [<u>apparently going well</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/undertales-toby-fox-teases-arrival-of-deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-ps5-testers-are-slurping-the-last-drops-of-soda-from-between-the-ice-cubes-now/). The follow-up to his 2015 banger is entirely free, too, so you can get into the duo for just $1 during the Steam Spring Sale – an unbeatable deal if you ask me.*Hungry for more?
