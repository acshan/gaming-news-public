Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe remains one of the most mysterious projects currently in development at [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/). Unveiled two years ago as part of a wider celebration of the long-running series, it's the latest undertaking from Ubisoft Montreal – the creators of Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. The studio promises that Assassin's Creed Hexe will be a "very different" type of game, with the first teaser offering up exceptionally witchy vibes to match. 

Of all the [upcoming Assassin's Creed games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-assassins-creed-games/) currently in production, it's Codename Hexe that we're desperate for more information on. Particularly as the highly anticipated [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-red-guide/) and [Assassin's Creed Infinity](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-infinity-guide/) were recently delayed into 2025 – I don't know about you, but I need my historical fantasy fix! Still, that does mean that there's a whole host of [new Ubisoft games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-ubisoft-games/) to come for PC,  PS5, and Xbox Series X. So while we wait for more information, keep on reading to find everything we know so far about Assassin's Creed Hexe. 

Assassin's Creed Hexe is described by Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Cote as a "new flagship title" in the series, one which will be "a very different type of Assassin's Creed game." That much is evident from the tone of the reveal, which opens with ominous music and dead leaves floating from rotting trees – a far cry from the bombast that has been typically associated with Assassin's Creed reveal trailers in the past. If this first look is anything to go by, Assassin's Creed Hexe could be the darkest installment to the series yet. 

It may only be 30 seconds long, but the Assassin's Creed Hexe trailer has got the gears of our brains turning. It's an effective mood piece, which concludes with an Assassin's Insignia – formed from broken branches – hanging from a tree, twirling above an open flame. It's haunting imagery that leaves a lot to the imagination, so perhaps it's no surprise that Ubisoft's Marc-Alexis Cote says that he "can't wait for our fans to tear apart that trailer and find out all its secrets." 



While Ubisoft is yet to officially confirm the Assassin's Creed Hexe setting, an uncorroborated rumor from [<u>Bloomberg</u>](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-06/ubisoft-set-to-announce-several-new-assassin-s-creed-games?srnd=technology-vp) has suggested that the game will be a witchy RPG set in Central Europe during the 16th Century Holy Roman Empire. A pivotal time in history, where mass hysteria gripped the continent as 80,000 people were executed for the crime of being in league with the devil - allegedly. Hearsay, fear, and spectral evidence were driving forces behind the devastating 16th Century witch trials, and it could make for a truly fascinating setting for an Assassin's Creed game. Unsurprisingly, [<u>longtime Assassin's Creed fans are already excited by the Witch Trials concept</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-fans-are-hyped-for-rumored-witch-trials-game/).



Assassin's Creed Hexe is being developed by Ubisoft Montreal – the "veteran team behind Assassin's Creed Valhalla." Ubisoft Montreal is the studio responsible for bringing the Assassin's Creed franchise to life in 2007, so it's no surprise that it'll be the driving force behind its future as well. Interestingly, Clint Hocking has been brought in as creative director to lead Assassin's Creed Hexe – Hocking is responsible for leading production on some of Ubisoft's most technically ambitious games, including Far Cry 2 and Watch Dogs Legion. Ubi's Marc-Alexis Cote describes Codename Hexe as "a very different type of Assassin's Creed game", and, honestly, we wouldn't expect anything less from Hocking.
