[Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-shadows-guide/) is based in Japan, but the script was written in English, and the Japanese voice actors have shared their thoughts on working on the game.

In an IGN video, Mutsuki Iwanaka says: "When I was dubbing my lines, I could hear the English dialogue. Dubbing Japanese lines over the original English in this very Japanese setting made this an unusual and interesting experience."

The [Assassin's Creed games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-assassins-creed-games/) are set all over the world, from Baghdad to Boston, London to Cairo. In the earlier games, even though they were originally voiced in English, characters still had accents that sounded region appropriate, but not all of the games are dubbed in the language of the locations they're set in, and I never thought about how strange that dubbing process must be.

Miyuri Shimabukuro, the Japanese voice actor for protagonist Naoe, says it was [the romance options](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-romance-will-boast-more-developed-relationships-for-naoe-and-yasuke-says-ubisoft-lead/) that challenged her. "Depending on the player's choices, Naoe may be involved in a romance thread," she explains. "So I had to think hard about how much of that essence to reveal as well."

Makoto Tamura, the Japanese voice actor for Nagato-no-Kami Fujibayashi, seemed to find the whole experience fairly easy. "As far as the tone of the vocabulary goes, the script had already been well translated," he says. "So all I had to do was read out the lines as they were and it was fine. I've watched period films since I was a kid and I love them, so the Sengoku Period vocabulary and samurai speak felt familiar. That part of the script came surprisingly naturally to me."
