[<u>Assassin's Creed Shadows</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-shadows-guide/) is the success story [<u>Ubisoft</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-ubisoft-games/) needs as it takes the number one spot on Steam's top sellers chart in multiple countries.

Assassin's Creed Shadows only came out yesterday, but it's already the top-selling Steam game in the US, UK, Brazil, Singapore, and more countries. The game's official Twitter account writes: "Excited to be backâ€¦ Full Steam ahead! Thank you for your support, Assassins!"

It's no surprise the game is doing so well considering [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) tweeted that it had [<u>over one million players</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-1-million-players-on-day-one-and-it-sounds-like-even-ubisofts-having-a-tough-time-believing-it-its-not-even-4pm-here/) not even a full 24 hours after launching.

After the [<u>middling success of Star Wars Outlaws</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-is-a-little-disappointed-with-the-metacritic-score-but-plans-to-keep-improving-the-game/) and the decision to [<u>shut down the live-service shooter XDefiant</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/xdefiant-is-shutting-down-as-ubisoft-closes-san-francisco-and-osaka-offices-following-long-journey-of-free-to-play-struggles-up-to-177-devs-impacted/) just months after it was released, Shadows needed to be a big win for Ubisoft. [<u>It was delayed several times</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-yet-again-this-time-to-march-2025-amid-ubisofts-renewed-focus-on-gameplay-quality-and-engaging-day-1-experiences/) so that the company could polish it and ensure it was to a high standard, and it seems like that was absolutely the correct decision, as reviews have been great too. In our own [Assassin's Creed Shadows review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-review/), we said the game has "more confidence, texture, and purpose than we've seen since Assassin's Creed pivoted into RPG territory," and we've ranked it highly on our list of the [best Assassin's Creed games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-assassins-creed-games/), too.

Ubisoft is reportedly currently [<u>working on some sort of "IP unit"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-is-reportedly-laying-the-groundwork-for-a-new-company-unit-focusing-on-its-most-valuable-series-including-assassins-creed/) that would include franchises like Assassin's Creed. No one is actually sure exactly what this is yet, but with the success of Shadows, it should be easier for the company to convince investors to back its alleged plans.

These sales figures should also help appease shareholders, one of whom was reportedly [<u>planning a protest</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-shareholder-plans-protest-in-response-to-mismanagement-assassins-creed-shadows-delays-and-alleged-acquisition-talks-with-microsoft-and-ea/) against the company's "horribly mismanaged" plans and "declining shareholder value." Ubisoft's stock did get a little bump earlier this month, but it's down year on year.

Shadows was [<u>discussed by the Prime Minister of Japan</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/assassins-creed-shadows-draws-attention-of-japans-prime-minister-who-says-defacing-a-shrine-is-out-of-the-question-in-real-life-but-politicians-acknowledge-freedom-of-expression-must-be-respected-in-the-game/) due to a controversy started by an [<u>Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview-stealthier-and-bloodier-than-ever/) that showed someone desecrating shrines in-game. There has since been [<u>a day-one patch</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-removes-blood-and-makes-shrines-indestructible-following-backlash/) that makes some of the objects within indestructible.
