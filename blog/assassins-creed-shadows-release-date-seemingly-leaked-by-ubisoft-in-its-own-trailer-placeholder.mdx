[Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) has officially confirmed that [Assassin's Creed Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-red-guide/) is now Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it seems the publisher has also unofficially - but quite accidentally - confirmed the game's release date.

Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to launch on November 15, 2024, according to screencaps of the description attached to the upcoming trailer's [YouTube placeholder page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8). The date has since been scrubbed from the description, but there [have been](https://twitter.com/Andreaalex2001/status/1790059431142523153) enough [separate accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cr64td/possible_release_date_for_assassins_creed_shadows/) of its existence that I'm inclined to think Ubisoft did indeed goof and leave in details about the launch day.

Ubisoft has previously said that the game is [set to launch this fiscal year](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-red-ubisofts-open-world-rpg-set-in-japan-is-set-to-launch-by-march-2025/) - meaning sometime before March 2025 - and every single previous mainline entry in the series has launched in either October or November. A November launch would also give Shadows some breathing room against [Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/), the other big Ubisoft open-world game for 2024, which is due to land at the end of August.

The metadata for Shadows' [Ubisoft Store](https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/221109/864200/12050?subId1=grd-us-4397149593527313369&sharedId=grd-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a17fbff4e2940488bce.html%3Flang%3Den_US) listing seemed to suggest that the game would launch across PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PS4, but there have since been some [reports swirling](https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1790055456913645712) that the game will fully ditch PS4 in favor of current-gen platforms. It's likely all this information will be confirmed or debunked very soon, as the official cinematic trailer is set to debut on May 15.
