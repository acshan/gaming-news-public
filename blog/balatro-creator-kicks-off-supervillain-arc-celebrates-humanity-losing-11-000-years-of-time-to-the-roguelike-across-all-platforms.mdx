Balatro's taking over the world, and creator Localthunk is loving the view from the top.

We've seen nothing but a string of successes from the poker roguelike (in the absolute simplest terms) since it launched back in February, going on to [sell 50,000 copies in 10 days](https://www.gamesradar.com/balatro-the-surprise-smash-hit-success-of-2024-from-a-solo-developer-has-sold-over-500000-copies-in-just-10-days/), and then a million copies in under a month, and [double that by August](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-is-getting-a-major-gameplay-update-this-year-with-new-ideas-and-strategies-as-the-roguelike-poker-sensation-sells-2-million-copies/). More recently, [it beat out Stardew Valley and Minecraft on the mobile sales charts](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-in-disbelief-as-the-roguelike-hit-tops-mobile-sales-charts-beating-minecraft-and-stardew-valley-despite-one-pesky-issue/) and was [nominated for three different awards at the Golden Joysticks](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-reacts-to-award-nomination-by-telling-you-to-vote-for-another-indie-a-truly-deserving-gem/).

Now we have a completely different metric by which to measure Balatro's monumental success, as Localthunk is celebrating the fact that "Balatro has been cumulatively played for over 11,000 years across all platforms."¬†

That is an absolutely staggering figure, and frankly Localthunk seems a little too eager to celebrate humanity losing that much collective time to a video game, even if it is their own. [At least the dev apologized when the mobile port was released even as the game's publisher half-joked, "productivity be damned"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatros-solo-dev-says-im-sorry-as-their-hit-indie-roguelike-prepares-to-launch-on-mobile-this-month-productivity-be-damned/).

All joking aside, it's been something else watching a relatively niche release become such a behemoth in a fairly short length of time. After all, [Localthunk themselves said a few months back that they only expected to sell "maybe 10 copies" and then go back to their IT job](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/solo-dev-behind-roguelike-hit-balatro-expected-to-sell-maybe-10-copies-and-go-back-to-their-it-job-but-they-went-on-to-sell-one-million-copies-instead/). Apparently, [it wasn't until "a day before launch" that they realized they might just have a hit on their hands](https://www.gamesradar.com/despite-making-one-of-the-best-roguelike-card-games-ever-solo-balatro-dev-only-realized-the-day-before-launch-they-might-be-onto-a-hit/).
