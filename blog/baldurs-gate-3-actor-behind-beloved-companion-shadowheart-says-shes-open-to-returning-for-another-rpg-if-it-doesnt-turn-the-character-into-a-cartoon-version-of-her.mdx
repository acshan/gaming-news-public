As [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) continues to receive updates from developer Larian Studios, fans of the RPG and its cast alike are looking toward the series' future - and some, including the voice actor behind Shadowheart herself, would be willing to return for Baldur's Gate 4 under the right circumstances.

Speaking in a recent [<u>interview</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/dont-kick-squirrels-baldurs-gate-3s-jennifer-english-talks-bringing-gods-favorite-princess-to-life-and-her-conditions-for-playing-shadowheart-again/) with GamesRadar+, Shadowheart voice actor Jennifer English reveals that she and the rest of the [<u>Baldur's Gate 3 companions</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-companions-party/) would gladly return to work on the game's sequel - if, and only if, it stays true to what made the Dungeons & Dragons series' third entry so great. "I think we're all open to the future of it," explains English, going on to describe what conditions Baldur's Gate 4 would first need to meet.

"If there is a future with Shadowheart," continues the actor, "I would want it to be beautifully written and honor the game's audience, and how inclusive and forward-thinking Larian is. If that opportunity came up and she *was* beautifully written, and that audience and inclusivity *was* honored, I would certainly consider it - but only with those conditions." She's serious about that last part, too, and goes on to reassert as much.

"I wouldn't want to take her and make her into a cartoon version of her," she concludes. "I'd want to go forward with that only if it honors her in a way I think we would all be proud of." It's an exciting thought, but there's no telling what direction Baldur's Gate 4 will take. Hasbro previously admitted it's still [<u>"talking to lots of partners"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dandd-owner-hasbro-is-already-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-the-next-baldurs-gate-game-and-hopes-its-not-another-25-years-before-it-comes-out/) about making the sequel, though, so it's likely to happen someday - and I for one can't wait until it does.
