As Larian Studios gears up to release the long-awaited [<u>Patch 8</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/larian-wasnt-kidding-when-it-said-its-not-quite-done-baldurs-gate-3-update-will-add-12-new-subclasses-crossplay-photo-mode-and-more-next-year/#:~:text=Patch%208%20will%20also%20add,now%20we%20have%20the%20details.) for [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/), fans are remaining as creative as ever with projects like [<u>custom campaigns</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/custom-baldurs-gate-3-campaigns-with-levels-and-lands-comparable-to-the-skyrim-modding-community-could-come-this-year-says-one-of-the-rpgs-experienced-modders/) and short animations for the RPG – one of which has caught the developers' attention.

The [<u>animation in question</u>](https://x.com/avercwh/status/1900179925694636152), an 18-second-long clip of party banter shared between beloved [<u>Baldur's Gate 3 companions</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-companions-party/) Karlach and Shadowheart, was created by 2D animator Claire. It features dialogue between the two characters including the accompanying in-game voice acting from Jennifer English and Samantha Béart, as Karlach tells a concerned Shadowheart that "it might be all downhill from here."

As a hardened Baldur's Gate 3 stan myself, I replayed the animation about a million times and walked away wishing there were more – and it seems I'm not the only one. The official Baldur's Gate 3 account [<u>responded to the video</u>](https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1901571584206225679) calling it "absolutely brilliant," with Larian publishing director Michael "Cromwelp" Douse leaving a separate [<u>reply</u>](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1901594767886090504) himself in which he praises Claire's "great" clip.

I maintain that a mature BG3 cartoon series would pop the fuck off if someone continued our legacy of those shorts. (This is great). https://t.co/qeJQkM7OAZ[March 17, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1901594767886090504)

"I maintain that a mature BG3 cartoon series would pop the fuck off if someone continued our legacy of those shorts," writes Douse. "This is great." Other fans agree, too, with one suggesting a show from "the people behind Castlevania" – an idea that I would certainly get behind. For now, however, I'll personally be keeping an eye on Claire's social media in case more party banter-oriented animations drop.

There's no better way to gear up for Patch 8 than by reacquainting oneself with why the community fell in love with the Baldur's Gate 3 cast in the first place, I'd say – and with actors like Shadowheart's own stating they'd be [<u>"open" to returning for another RPG</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-actor-behind-beloved-companion-shadowheart-says-shes-open-to-returning-for-another-rpg-if-it-doesnt-turn-the-character-into-a-cartoon-version-of-her/) and Hasbro previously admitting it's [<u>"talking to lots of partners"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dandd-owner-hasbro-is-already-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-the-next-baldurs-gate-game-and-hopes-its-not-another-25-years-before-it-comes-out/) about Baldur's Gate 4, we might even get to experience it all over again someday.
