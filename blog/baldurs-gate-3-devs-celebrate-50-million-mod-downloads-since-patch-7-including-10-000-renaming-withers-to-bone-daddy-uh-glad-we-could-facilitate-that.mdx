Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian says there have been 50 million mod downloads for the game since September's [<u>Patch 7</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-out-now-on-pc-with-truly-colossal-18000-word-patch-notes-introducing-full-mod-support-new-evil-endings-and-even-harder-honour-mode-fights/). You'd never guess it, but a portion of those mods were acts of devotion. More specifically, 10,000 mods were downloaded to BG3 with the purpose of renaming Withers, a shriveled skeleton man, to "Bone Daddy." 

"So, uh, glad we could facilitate that," Larian says on its [<u>Twitter announcement</u>](https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1851655300258185699).

What about Withers has people so eager to be undead? Let's think about it. First, Withers is a man of mystery. The camp companion never offers much backstory, instead electing to describe himself as a "keeper of records." So kind of like the DMV, I guess. 

That isn't particularly sexy in itself, but then Withers — who allows players to resurrect companions — wears some really awesome leather shoulder pads. And his eyes are a beautiful shade of lake blue, if you can look past the fact that the skin around them has the same texture as tree bark. 

Okay, I don't really get it. But, clearly, other people do. Otherwise, they wouldn't have made [<u>stickers</u>](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1161492&xcust=grd_us_4024990459550071582&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F1599771845%2Fwithers-art-thou-nasty-baldurs-gate-3&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Frpg%2Fbaldurs-gate-3-devs-celebrate-50-million-mod-downloads-since-patch-7-including-10-000-renaming-withers-to-bone-daddy-uh-glad-we-could-facilitate-that) of Withers arching his back while shirtless, or downloaded all those Bone Daddy mods. 

And they wouldn't be downloading this [<u>"big naturals" mod</u>](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8738), either, which voice actor Stephen Boxer finds disappointing for how its "bazongas" make Withers' back ache, as he says in [<u>a Cameo</u>](https://www.tiktok.com/@.bhaal.babe/video/7415421049581374763). 

If you're wondering how Withers' petite frame can handle having any breasts at all, allow me to direct you to the [<u>"very handsome and beautiful"</u>](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4037) Withers mod, which appears to inject his face with copious amounts of lip filler. Withers fans think of everything. 

And they are everywhere. "I am one of 10,000," the [<u>official Larian account</u>](https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1851656675662446613) replies to Larian's tweet. What a powerful community. 

[<u><em>Baldur's Gate 3 looks like a totally different RPG with a first-person camera mod, and it's so cool that Larian lead Swen Vincke says "I want to play this."</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-looks-like-a-totally-different-rpg-with-a-first-person-camera-mod-and-its-so-cool-that-larian-lead-swen-vincke-says-i-want-to-play-this/)
