Since [<u>Disco Elysium</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/disco-elysium-is-my-game-of-the-year-because-it-made-me-care-about-a-lost-shoe/) studio ZA/UM split up, several [<u>spiritual successors</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-spiritual-successor-to-disco-elysium-thats-continuing-a-legacy-of-rpgs-like-baldurs-gate-fallout-and-icewind-dale-is-in-the-works-from-bungie-rockstar-and-za-um-veterans/) have popped up to carry the torch, but Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach actor has some choice words for people who try to hire them in a project without the original creator's involvement.

Samantha Béart, who shot to fame as in their role as Karlach in 2023, tweeted "To the next studio that tries this: if your 'spiritual successor' to Disco Elysium does not involve creator Robert Kurvitz, then save both of us some time and miss me with that casting call." Ouch.

Béart clearly holds a lot of respect for Kurvitz and his work if they're not even willing to entertain offers from any Disco Elysium-related games that aren't involving him. Disco Elysium is a fantastic game, one I thoroughly enjoy, but it's wild to think it's had such an effect on people that they're willing to turn down work because the original creator isn't involved. I suppose when you're Karlach you get your pick of the jobs, though.

[<u>Disco Elysium was conceived</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/) during a drunken night in Tallinn, "We were just hanging around in total squalor and poverty," Kurvitz says. It went on to become a hit, but then the studio fell apart and many of the game's developers went their separate ways.

In just one day, [<u>two spiritual successors</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-second-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-has-been-announced-from-a-different-breakaway-group-of-devs-who-worked-on-the-original-rpg/) to the critically acclaimed RPG were announced. Neither of those studios have Robert Kurvitz working with them. The Disco Elysium creator set the game in the same world as his novel, Sacred and Terrible Air, which is an incredible title. It didn't do well, though. "It sold 1,000 copies," says Kurvitz. "So after that I succumbed to deep alcoholism."

To the next studio that tries this: if your “spiritual successor” to Disco Elysium does not involve creator Robert Kurvitz, then save both of us some time and miss me with that casting call.[February 11, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1889295977162432844)

[<u>Kurvitz made a new studio</u>](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/another-group-of-ex-disco-elysium-developers-found-dark-math-games) with DIsco Elysium lead artist Aleksander Rostov, Red Info. It's backed by NetEase, which did a [<u>u-turn on its Marvel Rivals mid-season rank reset</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/mere-hours-after-enraging-marvel-rivals-players-with-the-announcement-of-a-mid-season-rank-reset-netease-games-quickly-u-turns-players-will-retain-their-ranks-and-scores/) just hours after it was announced.
