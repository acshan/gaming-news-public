With the help of just a few mods, [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) can go from a third-person experience you click your way through to a first-person RPG with WASD controls - and Larian Studios lead Swen Vincke himself wants to give the latter way to play a go.

A recent [<u>video</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGCAWyXVJ40&ab_channel=ProxyGateTactician) from YouTuber Proxy Gate Tactician highlights a game-changing combination of mods, overhauling everything from camera tweaks to character movement. With all of the mods in place, including one that alters your Tav's size a bit to allow for first-person, the RPG feels more like a blend of [<u>Dragon Age</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age/) and [<u>Skyrim</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/skyrim-guide/) than Baldur's Gate 3 - and it's one of the most unique ways I've ever seen Larian's virtual Dungeons & Dragons gem played.

I'm not the only one who feels that way, either. Responding to Proxy Gate Tactician's video in a recent [post](https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1849087722763297200), Larian CEO Swen Vincke shares his thoughts on the combo of mods: "Now I want to play this - just look at it." I'm in the same boat as Vincke myself, and I can't wait to try to configure my game the same way so that I can pet Scratch in first-person and fully immerse myself within the glowing depths of the Underdark.

Now I want to play this - just look at it: https://t.co/BKUQlItAL6 - pic.twitter.com/YWCVlgmLPn[October 23, 2024](https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1849087722763297200)

All we need now is for the [<u>real-time combat mod</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-returns-to-the-combat-roots-set-out-by-the-original-dandd-rpgs-as-one-intrepid-modder-gets-real-time-fights-working-with-a-nod-to-neverwinter-nights/) to come to fruition fully - the sheer chaos of it would certainly be something to look forward to. With a first-person camera, clean WASD controls, and real-time combat, Baldur's Gate 3 would feel like a distant cousin to its former self. It probably won't happen for a while, though - the real-time combat mod is still "VERY barebones at the moment" and not "suitable for use with the campaign yet."
