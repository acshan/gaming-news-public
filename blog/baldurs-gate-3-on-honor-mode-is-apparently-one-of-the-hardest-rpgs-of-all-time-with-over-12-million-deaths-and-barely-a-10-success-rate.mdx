Larian has been talking about how many of you have completed Baldur's Gate 3's Honour Mode, and it ain't many.

To celebrate the hit RPG's one-year anniversary, Larian is busting out the stats. A [special infographic](https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821187150081356110) dedicated to the single-save permadeath mode reveals that 141,660 have survived a run since the difficulty tier was added late last year. That's cool, but Larian also reveals that 1.2 million of you failed, which means Honour Mode barely has a 10% success rate.

Not content at stopping there, the [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) studio goes on to reveal that 76% of defeated players "honorably deleted their save game," while 24% continued their adventure in custom mode.

For a while, the hardest difficulty you could play Baldur's Gate 3 on was Tactician, which beefed up enemies' health, made them nastier, and gave them more special powers. It also makes it more expensive to buy items and more costly to get a good Long Rest at camp. Come Patch 5, though, we got [Baldur's Gate 3's Honour Mode](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-honour-mode/), which builds on Tactician rules by adding a single save system that'll stop you from save-scumming and party permadeath. As you can see from the stats above, it's *somewhat *challenging.

Naturally, some who did defeat Honour Mode didn't leave it there. One ["invented an exploit"](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-player-invented-an-exploit-to-somehow-beat-honour-mode-by-only-casting-the-rpgs-worst-spell-2469-times/) to somehow beat the horrible mode by only casting the RPG's worst spell 2,469 times, while another said ['why stop there?'](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-sadist-beats-the-rpgs-hardest-mode-with-an-even-more-brutal-custom-ruleset-no-companions-no-hirelings-no-long-rests-no-tadpoles-no-trading-and-not-even-any-stealing/) and added more rules â€“ No companions, no hirelings, no long rests, no tadpoles, no trading, and no stealing. Truly built different.
