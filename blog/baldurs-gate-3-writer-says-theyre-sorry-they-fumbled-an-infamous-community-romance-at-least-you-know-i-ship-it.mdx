If there's one thing [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) stans have been dreaming about, it's the ability to romance Gortash - and one of Larian Studios' former narrative design leads wishes they could make it come true.

The [<u>Baldur's Gate 3 companions</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-companions-party/) are unique, each with distinct personalities and looks - from the aggressive Lae'zel to the cunning Astarion. There's just one flavor of companion missing, and it's one that would complement [<u>Dark Urge</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-dark-urge/) Tavs quite nicely - evil. You could argue that Minthara fits the bill, but she just doesn't cut it compared to the main three antagonists - Orin, Ketheric, and the handsome devil stealing fans' hearts, Gortash.

It isn't just fans, though - the RPG's companion and romance lead would also love to rewrite the script to allow for long-requested Dark Urge x Gortash action. Speaking in an interview with [<u>Eurogamer</u>](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-making-of-the-dark-urge-in-baldurs-gate-3), writer Baudelaire Welch reveals that while they personally "believe in the Dark Urge x Gortash ship wholeheartedly," they "never saw it coming." Gortash's popularity came as a surprise - as did his presentation in-game.

Sorry I fumbled the aging scene band frontman x bad dragon you guys, at least you know I ship it - seeing durgetash stuff is perhaps my favourite fan content ðŸ–¤ https://t.co/IMRAs7rfxp[August 12, 2024](https://twitter.com/space_poets/status/1822935343898710134)

"I think we always imagined that Gortash was going to be an 80-year-old man over the course of development, and then we saw his model and it was like, 'Oh!'" Suddenly, the villain was more akin to a hot emo boy band vocalist than an elder like Ketheric. "I so, so, so wish that I had seen that coming and added some optional hints of reactivity into that whole thing," says Welch, thinking back on the possibilities.

In a follow-up [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/space_poets/status/1822935343898710134) about the Dark Urge x Gortash ship that sadly never sailed, Welch jokes that they're "Sorry I fumbled the aging scene band frontman x bad dragon" - but says "at least you know I ship it." Unfortunately, it's likely that Larian won't get around to allowing us to smooch the bad guy with good hair - the studio recently said [<u>you still can't make out with the "complicated" yet handsome Gortash in the RPG's upcoming patch</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-devs-say-you-still-cant-make-out-with-the-complicated-yet-handsome-gortash-in-the-rpgs-upcoming-patch-babygurl-doesnt-have-time-to-kiss/).
