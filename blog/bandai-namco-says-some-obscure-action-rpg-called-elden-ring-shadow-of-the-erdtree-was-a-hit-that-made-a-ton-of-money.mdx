Hold onto your seats, folks, [Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/)'s universally acclaimed [Shadow of the Erdtree DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-guide/) that everybody has been raving about for weeks sold really well.

As revealed in Elden Ring publisher [Bandai Namco](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bandai-namco/)'s [first quarter financial results](https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/E_2024080820E6A5ADE7B8BEE4BA88E683B3E381AEE4BFAEE6.pdf), Shadow of the Erdtree boosted the company's digital operating profit in its entertainment sector by 553% year-over-year, enough to prompt this ecstatic, over-the-top reaction in the document: "On the business side, Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree, the major downloadable content of the home console game Elden Ring, was a hit, contributing to the operating results in the Digital Business."

Elsewhere in the results summary, Bandai Namco showed aÂ 24.8% increase in net sales and a 56.3% rise in profit for the three months that ended on June 30, 2024. It's no coincidence that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released about a week prior on June 21.

Of course, none of this is a surprise. Shadow of the Erdtree was an instant success at launch, [beating giant full-game releases like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-the-highest-rated-release-of-2024-so-far-beating-jrpg-hit-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-roguelike-darling-hades-2/) in ratings and [selling five million units in its first three days](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-5-million-sales-in-3-days-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-rivaling-the-outstanding-success-of-the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-dlc/). The DLC's success rivals some of the biggest DLC releases of all time, including [Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-guide/) and The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine. [As soon as it became the highest rated DLC for an RPG ever, CDPR even congratulated Bandai Namco with some awesome custom art of Geralt in Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-overtaken-the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-as-the-highest-rated-dlc-but-the-new-runners-up-dont-mind-if-any-game-had-to-do-it-im-happy-its-elden-ring/).
