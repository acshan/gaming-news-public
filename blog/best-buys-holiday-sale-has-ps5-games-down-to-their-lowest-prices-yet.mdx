Best Buy is getting into the festive spirit this week, with holiday sales continuing some of the biggest price drops I've seen on PS5 games to date. Between oldies like God of War and The Last of Us and new 2024 blockbusters like Dragon Age: The Veilguard and Astro Bot, there are plenty of discounts up for grabs right now.

Most of these savings were first spotted over Black Friday, but where some retailers have hiked their prices back up since the sale ended last week the big yellow label is still holding on. That means you'll find big-name releases sitting [as low as $29.99](https://shop-links.co/link?qp=category_facet%3DAll+Video+Games~pcmcat1487698928729%5Eplatformcompatibilitymv_facet%3DCompatible+Platform~PlayStation+5&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=grd-us-8710188593025815450&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpromo%2Fvideo-game-and-vr-deals%3Fqp%3Dcategory_facet%253DAll%2520Video%2520Games~pcmcat1487698928729%255Eplatformcompatibilitymv_facet%253DCompatible%2520Platform~PlayStation%25205&article_name=Best%20Buy's%20holiday%20sale%20has%20PS5%20games%20down%20to%20their%20lowest%20prices%20yet&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbest-buys-holiday-sale-has-ps5-games-down-to-their-lowest-prices-yet) - but I've picked out five PS5 deals that top the rest this week.

Yes, some of last month's offers are now off the table. Silent Hill hasn't quite made it back down to $30 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has jumped back to full MSRP. That means I don't know how long these holiday sales will last at Best Buy - if you spot a price you like, I'd jump in sooner rather than later. You'll find all my top picks from this week's [PS5 deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-price-bundle-deals/) just below.

God of War Ragnarök | [$69.99 $29.99 at Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=grd-us-1339264039441304587&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgod-of-war-ragnarok-standard-edition-playstation-5%2F6523243.p&article_name=Best%20Buy's%20holiday%20sale%20has%20PS5%20games%20down%20to%20their%20lowest%20prices%20yet&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbest-buys-holiday-sale-has-ps5-games-down-to-their-lowest-prices-yet%2F%2Fgames%2Fbest-buys-holiday-sale-has-ps5-games-down-to-their-lowest-prices-yet)*Save $40 - *God of War Ragnarök is back down to its lowest price yet at Best Buy, with the retailer shaving a massive $40 off the final cost.

Best Buy's current holiday sale is slated to end on December 25, but those discounts often roll into After Christmas sales pretty quickly afterwards. Still, with a number of games heading back up the price scale at other retailers (and some even climbing at Best Buy itself), I wouldn't wait much longer. That's especially true considering these are all physical copies - if you're gifting, it's worth heading to checkout within the next week to guarantee delivery in time for the big day.

I tend to see these annual holiday sales running until the start of the next year. Retailers will extend some of their Black Friday prices into December, driving up momentum for the festive period, before offering a smaller selection of deals after Christmas Day. The final days of these offers tend to sit between December 29 and January 1, when stores really do close out sales.
