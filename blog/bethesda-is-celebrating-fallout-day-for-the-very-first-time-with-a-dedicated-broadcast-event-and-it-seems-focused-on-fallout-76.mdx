Bunker-dwellers have something to celebrate later in the week, as Bethesda is promising a dedicated broadcast event to clue us into its plans for [Fallout 76](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-guide/).

"Fallout Day is coming on October 23,where we will be hosting our first ever #FalloutDay Broadcast," the developer shared on its [Twitter](https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1846567782223106259) page. "Join Jon Rush and Bill LaCoste as they give you a glimpse at what we've been working on in Fallout 76." The Tweet goes on to link out to [@FalloutforHope](https://x.com/FalloutforHope), a charity initiative championing a Community Parade as part of this year's Fallout Day, while a promotional Tweet from the offical Fallout [Twitter](https://x.com/Fallout/status/1846567292991099192) account promises "developer interviews" and more.

For those not yet in the know, Fallout Day is an annual "holiday" commemorating the start of the Great War in Bethesda's Fallout universe. Not dissimilar to [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/)'s N7 Day for Mass Effect fans, or The Last of Us' Outbreak Day, Fallout Day gives franchise superfans space to talk about their favorite game with fellow die-hards â€“ only now, it seems we'll be getting brand new information on the future of Fallout 76 as Bethesda steps up to take part for the first time, too.

Sadly, there seems to be no mention of [Fallout 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-5-guide/) news planned for the broadcast event, nor indeed any word of Amazon Prime's [Fallout season two](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-season-2-release-date-cast-prime-video/). That doesn't mean we can't hold out just a tiny bit of hope when we join the [Fallout Day Twitch broadcast](https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda), currently scheduled for 3pm EST / 8pm BST on October 23, 2024.
