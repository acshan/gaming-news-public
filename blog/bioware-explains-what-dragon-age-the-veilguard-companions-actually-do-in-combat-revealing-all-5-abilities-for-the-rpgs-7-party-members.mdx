As we inch ever closer to the long-awaited launch of [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/), [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) has just released a few more details on the RPG's companions, including a full list of everyone's abilities and some info on what they all do in combat.

Each companion in The Veilguard has five abilities, but you can only select three of them to bring into combat at a time. Building your relationship with a given companion will increase your Relationship Level with them, and each level will get you a skill point that you can use to improve that companion's abilities. This info was all reported in a now sadly defunct Game Informer article, but you can still view an archived version thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240709111137/https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard).

Now BioWare has just updated the [official Veilguard website](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/game-lore#companions) with new companion profiles, each of which includes a brief bio, a full list of abilities, and a brief overview of that character's role in combat. Personally, it'll take a lot to keep me away from Taash, the Qunari dragon hunter, who both dual-wields axes and literally *breathes fire*. What better tool for a dragon hunter than that?Â 

BioWare noted that August 26 would be the kickoff of Companion Week for The Veilguard back when it [revealed the promotional roadmap earlier in August](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/after-10-long-years-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-its-release-date-tomorrow-as-bioware-details-a-roadmap-with-info-on-high-level-combat-and-the-pc-version/). The week is just getting started, so it's safe to expect some more info drops on the game's companions in the days to come.
