[Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-veilguard-guide/) is officially out in the wild, and [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) is hoping its success will bring the studio back into the fans' good graces.

A new [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-01/-dragon-age-the-veilguard-faced-turbulent-development-high-stakes-at-bioware) report details Dragon Age: The Veilguard's turbulent development, which saw the project go through two internal reboots, first from a single-player RPG to a live-service game and then back to the single-player RPG that ultimately released on Halloween. BioWare boss Gary McKay told Bloomberg "a lot of things started to fall into place" following the decision to ditch the live-service idea and go back to the studio's roots.

And then you have the [BioWare layoffs](https://www.gamesradar.com/bioware-lays-off-50-developers-as-part-of-a-plan-to-ensure-dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-an-outstanding-game/) that happened in August 2023, as well as [reported internal delays](https://www.gamesradar.com/internal-dragon-age-dreadwolf-delays-are-reportedly-pushing-mass-effect-5-back-too/), oh, and Covid-19 caused the studio to shift over to remote hiring, posing another hurdle for the studio to clear. It seems something of a minor miracle when you consider all of its headwinds that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now in players' hands, and is getting pretty darn good reviews too.

GamesRadar+'s 4/5-star [Dragon Age: The Veilguard review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/) calls the game "a true return to RPG form for BioWare," praising the "captivating companions with rich arcs," the "action-oriented combat that's tough but fair," and the "catnip for lore nerds."

Meanwhile, [the game is topping sales charts and breaking Steam records for the studio](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/turns-out-people-still-like-single-player-bioware-rpgs-as-dragon-age-the-veilguard-tops-sales-charts-and-breaks-steam-records-for-the-studio/). All of this is likely music to McKay's ears, who's assuredly feeling the pressure to deliver a success following its one-two punch of disappointment with 2017's Mass Effect: Andromeda and 2019's failed shooter Anthem. Indeed, McKay said he hopes Dragon Age: The Veilguard will "bring BioWare back into the conversation as a top game studio."

Naturally, BioWare parent company EA is hoping the same, with [CEO Andrew Wilson saying in a recent investors call that Dragon Age: The Veilguard has "breakout capabilities" due to "incredibly strong" reviews and "limited competition" in the AAA space](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/ea-says-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-breakout-capabilities-due-to-incredibly-strong-reviews-and-limited-competition-in-the-aaa-space/).
