Over a decade has passed since Mass Effect 3 first graced fans with its stellar story and sci-fi world, and [<u>BioWare</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) lead Michael Gamble is celebrating its 13th birthday with a post – but at the same time, he's also ensuring that readers are aware that's all his post is.

It's not a cryptic hint, a mysterious teaser, or any other flavor of a masked reveal – it's just a celebratory [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1897818095907225810) commemorating the monumental release of Mass Effect's third entry. "Happy birthday, ME3," writes Gamble, who is currently directing [<u>Mass Effect 5</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/mass-effect-5-guide/). The game means a lot to us. I'll leave it there. That way nobody can say I purposefully teased them or created some sort of news story hinting at the next game details."

Gamble's words are certainly funny, but he does have a point. As a fan of anything [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) myself, I admit the community seems to look into things – even when it shouldn't. It doesn't help that actual hidden hints do often drop, either, with past situations like the [<u>N7 Day 2023 teaser</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/figuring-out-what-the-n7-day-2023-teaser-means-for-mass-effect-5-is-sending-my-fan-theory-brain-into-overdrive/) coming to mind. BioWare's full focus shifting to Mass Effect 5, which is [<u>currently in "pre-production"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mass-effect/mass-effect-5-is-still-in-pre-production-says-director-as-bioware-shifts-full-focus-to-the-sci-fi-rpg-amid-dev-reshuffles-and-reported-layoffs/) now, after [<u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-veilguard-guide/) is also significant.

After all, fans yearn to know more about the beloved sci-fi RPG series' upcoming entry – and so far, BioWare hasn't revealed too much. Mass Effect 5 is the studio's [<u>only big project after The Veilguard</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mass-effect/mass-effect-5-is-biowares-only-big-project-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-studio-veteran-predicts-but-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people/) currently, though, which means that the community might get the long-awaited news it's hoping for soon. Until then, however, there are four brilliant Mass Effect gems to go back and replay – so I know what I'll be doing in the meantime.*Here are some of our most exciting *[<u><em>new games</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/)* this year and beyond to keep an eye on.*
