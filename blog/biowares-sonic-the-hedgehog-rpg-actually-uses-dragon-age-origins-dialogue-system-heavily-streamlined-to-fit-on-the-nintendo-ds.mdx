Former [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) veteran Mark Darrah has revealed that the storied studio's oft-forgotten, seemingly random Sonic RPG uses the same under-the-hood dialogue system as Dragon Age: Origins - or, rather, because of the order of release, maybe [Dragon Age](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age/) uses Sonic's code stack.

The former long-time Dragon Age executive producer revealed the interesting tidbit in a [new YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-k1q8IeIkTE), calling 2008's Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood his "favorite" project to work on because there was something "magical about leading a team as small as this game was - it never got much above 20 people."

Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood "actually uses Dragon Age: Origins' dialogue system," Darrah said. "Heavily streamlined to fit on the Nintendo DS, but it's still at its base the same code stack. I guess if you really wanted to try, you could make the argument that, because Sonic Chronicles shipped in 2008 and Dragon Age: Origins didn't ship until 2009, that Dragon Age: Origins actually shipped using the Sonic Chronicles dialogue system."

The Sonic RPG team eventually moved on to the cancelled Mass Effect DS game that was planned to have you pirating across the fringes of the galaxy in first person. The spin-off was scrapped due to the economics of shipping games on the Nintendo DS, though.

BioWare now doesn't have the bandwidth for any quirky projects like Sonic Chronicles, though. The entire studio now reportedly employs around 100 people after [EA cut even more roles from the team](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/as-layoffs-reportedly-hit-bioware-former-dragon-age-writer-tells-fans-not-to-worry-da-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now/). The publisher blamed the layoffs on Dragon Age: The Veilguard's performance, but one wonders how much more "agile" a team can get.
