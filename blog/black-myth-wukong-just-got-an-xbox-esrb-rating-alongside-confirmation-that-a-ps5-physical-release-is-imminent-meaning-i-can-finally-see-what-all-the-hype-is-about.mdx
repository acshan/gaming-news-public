There's hope on the horizon for [Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-guide/)'s delayed Xbox launch, with the ESRB quietly rating the [upcoming Xbox Series X game](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-xbox-series-x-games/) just as the developer confirms a physical PS5 launch is coming.

Eagle-eyed Black Myth hopefuls spotted the [ESRB rating](https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40203/black-myth-wukong/) earlier this week, which grants the Xbox Series X version of the action-RPG a Teen rating alongside its PS5 and PC counterparts. It's been two months since Game Science released Black Myth: Wukong on other current-gen platforms, and with the Xbox Series X launch delayed ["until it meets quality standards"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukongs-stealthy-xbox-delay-means-steams-most-wishlisted-game-is-now-coming-to-pc-and-ps5-first/), it's been a bitter pill to swallow for many owners of [Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/)'s flagship console. 

At the same time as the ESRB rating appeared online, a post on the official Black Myth [Twitter](https://x.com/blackmythgame/status/1847911254234468563?s=46&t=DjpC-MBX6M-pOtYN8dAWRg) account has confirmed another incoming milestone. "With the master disc for #BlackMythWukong ready, the PS5 physical edition will be available to you very soon," reads the Twitter announcement – meaning that PS5 owners could well see a physical launch before Black Myth arrives on Xbox digitally.

It's a bummer of a situation, but it's not uncommon for games to launch later on Xbox than on other platforms, potentially given the need to optimize for the Series S. We're looking at you, [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/). Still, the ESRB rating offers at least a* glimmer *of a* *promise that Black Myth: Wukong could be launching on Xbox sooner rather than later, though an official release date remains at large.
