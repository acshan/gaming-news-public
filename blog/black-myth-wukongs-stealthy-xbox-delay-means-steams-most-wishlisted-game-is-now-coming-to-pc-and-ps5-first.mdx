Update - June 8: Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science has confirmed in an [<u>FAQ</u>](https://heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11) dated June 8 that the Xbox version of the upcoming Soulslike action RPG has indeed been delayed due to quality concerns, which certainly reads like a nice way of saying the Xbox Series S, the weakest system on the platform list, is struggling to run this thing. Here's the developer's comment in full:

"PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024. We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards."

The studio's also confirmed that the physical editions of the game will only include digital vouchers, but no discs. Why? "It is the first time for Game Science to release a console game globally, and we are currently facing limitations in offline resources required for the import, export, transportation, distribution, and sales of physical discs. These factors have made it difficult for us to sell physical discs simultaneously with the official release of the game." The studio says it's exploring ways to offer physical discs, but there's no concrete news for now. 

Original story:

If you were enamored with the [<u>Black Myth: Wukong collector's edition</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-collectors-edition-price-release-date/) during today's [<u>Summer Game Fest Live</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/summer-game-fest-2024-live-coverage-everything-announced/) reveal and then thought it a bit odd that Xbox was conspicuously absent from the pre-order splash page, you were right. It turns out the Xbox version of the most-wishlisted game on Steam will now arrive sometime after PS5 and PC get it on August 20. 

"Note that a release date for the physical editions is pending," a press release from developer Game Science says of the deluxe and collector's editions, quickly adding that "release timing for the Xbox Series X|S version will be disclosed at a later time." 

The cynic in me wants to assume that the weaker hardware of the Xbox Series S has once again delayed the Xbox release of a multiplatform current-gen game, and frankly this read ain't even that cynical. That is, after all, [<u>exactly what happened with the long-delayed Xbox port of Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-will-launch-on-xbox-this-year-after-larian-and-phil-spencer-found-a-solution/); Larian couldn't get the game's splitscreen co-op up to snuff on the S and had to cut the feature entirely to get the port out. That said, I'm only speculating that Game Science is now facing a similar issue with its game, which certainly appears to be graphically intense. 

As it happens, [Summer Game Fest](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/summer-game-fest/) served up a preview of another promising action RPG, and with a clearer Soulslike twist. I [<u>was already kinda down for Enotria's Italian soulslike, and now I've seen its trident-blunderbuss, I'm all in</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/i-was-already-kinda-down-for-enotrias-italian-soulslike-and-now-ive-seen-its-trident-blunderbuss-im-all-in/), as our own Ali Jones puts it.
