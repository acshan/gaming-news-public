Bloodborne servers are undergoing maintenance on the same day that publisher [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) seemingly teased *something,* and for the first time in years, fan speculation around a remaster doesn't seem quite so far-fetched. I mean, it probably still won't happen, but I can see where Bloodborne fans are going with this one. 

People have been desperately asking for a Bloodborne remaster for so long and with so much gusto, the project has now entered the same mythical realm as Half-Life 3 and [Hollow Knight Silksong](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-silksong-guide/). That is to say that wishing for it to exist - and then slapping metaphorical clown makeup on - is basically an internet meme at this point. But the latest round of speculation seems a little more hopeful, which might make the potential disappointment even more hurtful.

BREAKING: #Bloodborne servers are undergoing maintenance on 12/03/2024. The SAME DATE that was hidden in a recent PlayStation trailer.Is a remaster/remake announcement FINALLY happening?! pic.twitter.com/XpI65kqulu[November 27, 2024](https://twitter.com/FromSoftUpdates/status/1861812284407923161)

When you now start the gothic action RPG, a pop-up message explains that online functionality will be disabled while servers undergo maintenance on December 3. Online maintenance is nothing noteworthy in itself, however, some fans noticed that a recent PlayStation marketing trailer teased that exact same date too.

The Play Has No Limits trailer below, published two weeks ago, has a brief shot at the 46-second mark showing a train station customer information screen. Despite being released in the middle of November, the screen shows a date of December 3, which some fans latched onto as a teaser for a games showcase or other announcement of some kind. 

That's all purely speculation, though, and we won't know whether anything's actually happening on the Bloodborne remaster front until December 3 comes and goes. PlayStation has been bringing several of its biggest hits to PC with God of War, [Marvel's Spider-Man 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/spider-man/spider-man-2-dlc-hopes-dashed-as-insomniac-confirms-we-have-no-additional-story-content-planned-while-touting-the-new-pc-port/), and Horizon all making the transition - and with developer [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/)'s long history on the platform, it is a little strange to see Bloodborne missing from the line-up.
