The Borderlands movie might have been a massive flop, but [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/)'s games are having a lovely resurgence in the aftermath of the movie's underwhelming launch.

The Borderlands movie just launched last week, and - spoiler alert - it's not great. Our [Borderlands review](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/borderlands-review/) lambasted it as "a frenetic and disorderly shambles gamers are likely to loathe," granting it just two stars. Other critics didn't love it either - at one point the [Borderlands movie held an astounding 0% approval rating](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/borderlands-movie-rotten-tomatoes-0-per-cent-score/) on Rotten Tomatoes from critics.Â 

Despite this stinker, it's not all bad news for Gearbox, developer of the Borderlands games. It turns out that the looter shooter series is having a bit of resurgence on Steam in the wake of the Borderlands movie, and I can only guess it's because moviegoers wanted to see if the series offered anything worthwhile after Eli Roth's adaptation.

According to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/#3y) for example, Borderlands 3 just hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 12,379, its highest peak concurrent player count since February 2023. Additionally, [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/#3y) has Borderlands 2 rising to 7,938 peak Steam players over the last few days, the shooter's highest peak concurrent player count since February 2021.

If you head over to the [Steam top-sellers chart](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers), you can see Borderlands 3 is currently outselling the likes of Baldur's Gate 3 and God of War, and while Borderlands 2 is significantly further down the chart, it's still outselling hits like Stardew Valley, Rainbow Six Siege, and Gearbox's own Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. It probably helps that both games are hugely discounted - Borderlands 3 with 90% off, and Borderlands 2 with 75% off.

It's a weirdly good time to get into Borderlands 3 - or to return to the shooter if you're a veteran player. A new update last week added the ability for [players to skip right to the very end of the game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-3-gets-its-second-update-of-2024-and-an-excellent-quality-of-life-feature-you-can-skip-to-the-end-of-the-shooter-if-youve-already-got-a-max-level-character/), provided they've already got a max level character - so you can basically go right to Borderlands 3's endgame with a different character.
