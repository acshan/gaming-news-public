The next Borderlands instalment is [officially on the way](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/borderlands-4-has-finally-been-revealed-and-its-out-in-2025-across-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/), and it's sounding set to be one gory affair.

It's just a teaser trailer, but [Borderlands 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-guide/)'s reveal at [Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/) has us chomping at the bit for more kooky looter shooter antics come its unspecified 2025 release date. But after a closer look at its newly-published [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/), it seems the new entry in the series is taking a decidedly more mature approach when it comes to certain themes, which is more than can be said for the [Borderlands movie](https://www.gamesradar.com/borderlands-movie-plot-cast-release-date/) (though you can read more about that "disorderly shambles" in our [Borderlands review](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/borderlands-review/)). Reportedly both [originally conceived and shot as an R-rated extravaganza](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/live-action-movies/borderland-filmed-as-an-r-rated-movie-stunt-coordinator-jimmy-odee/), that's not exactly how the PG-13 movie ended up. Thankfully, we shouldn't be seeing a repeat of that.

"The developers describe the content like this," reads the Borderlands 4 mature content description on its Steam storefront, stating that "this game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work."* *The reason? "Intense Violence or Gore, Suggestive Themes, Strong Language, General Mature Content."Â 

We have no idea how extreme this supposed gore and violence will end up being, but with a cryptic trailer showing a mechanical skeleton holding a burning gas-masked aloft over a backdrop of searing flames, Borderlands 4 might be the badass palate cleanser we've been desperate for [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/) to drop after all this time.
