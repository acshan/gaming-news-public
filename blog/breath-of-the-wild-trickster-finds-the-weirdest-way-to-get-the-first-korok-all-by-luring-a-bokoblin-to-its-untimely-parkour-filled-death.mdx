Having been out for seven years, there are plenty of you who are still dedicated to [Breath of the Wild](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide/), and recently, one player has shown off a rather unorthodox way to find the first (and simplest) Korok in the game.

Breath of the Wildâ€™s physics engine is one of the gameâ€™s greatest strengths and has allowed the creative players among you to turn Hyrule into a sandbox where you can do everything from using bombs to fly across the map to clipping your horses into walls, most of which is not doable in its sequel, [Tears of the Kingdom](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/). One popular trick to pull off is the Bullet-Time Bounce, which lets you use your shields to jump onto an enemyâ€™s head, sending you flying through the air, something that is, frankly, overkill for what one player had in mind.

In a video posted to Twitter by @HyrulesPheasant, we see them making good use of the BTB, luring a nearby bokoblin to the entrance of the Temple of Time. After getting themselves in position, they throw themselves out of a broken window with their shield on their feet, bounce off the bokoblinâ€™s head, bounce off the wall of the Temple before being catapulted towards the nearby pond, falling into a ring of lilypads and finding the Korok â€” pretty gnarly stuff.Â

For anyone who hasnâ€™t played Breath of the Wild, and isnâ€™t aware of how pointlessly elaborate this all is, the usual method of unlocking this particular Korok Seed is to simply jump into the circle from the bank of the pond directly above it. When coupled with the fact that you will likely pass this point within around 10 minutes of first starting the game, it seems unlikely that Nintendo had this solution in mind.
