You might remember Mouse: P.I. For Hire as the drop-dead gorgeous shooter that went viral across TikTok before going viral everywhere else on the internet. Some people called it a [Cuphead meets Call of Duty](https://www.gamesradar.com/this-indie-shooter-is-just-like-cuphead-meets-call-of-duty-and-its-the-wildest-thing-ive-ever-seen/) Frankenstein. Some people hailed it as the Steamboat Willie shooter we never knew we needed. But now it has a real name, and a brand new, very cool trailer.

Developer Fumi Games announced that their 1930s cartoon-inspired shooter is officially called Mouse: P.I. For Fire (previously just Mouse), because you play as P.I. Pepper, a mouse, and also happen to shoot lots of mice, naturally. Cartoon violence, Indiana Jones references, and some of the best first-person reload animations I've ever laid eyes on are all in the trailer below.

Despite the Steamboat Willie comparisons (heck, even I thought I saw a glimpse of Pete in the trailer), Mouse: P.I. For Hire isn't actually based on [Disney](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/disney/)'s early Mickey Mouse renditions. It just so happened to go viral right around the same time as Steamboat Willie's induction into the public domain, which probably gave those [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/) wishlists a bit of a bump. 

Mickey Mouse imitator or not, P.I. Pepper's romp looks confident enough in its own retro swagger and exaggerated crook-busting that it doesn't really need to rely on 100-year-old nostalgia. 

"Unravel a quest for justice in a noir city mired in chaos, corruption, and vibrant energy, utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons, power-ups, and explosives to thwart the takeover by corrupt politicians," the game's blurb explains. We'll need to wait for Mouse: P.I. For Hire to release sometime in 2025 before we can whack some anthropomorphic gangters.
