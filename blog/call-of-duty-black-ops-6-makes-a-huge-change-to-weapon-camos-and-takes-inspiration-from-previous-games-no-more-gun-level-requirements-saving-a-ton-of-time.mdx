In a frankly terrifyingly long explanation of how weapon camo unlocks work in [<u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-guide/) and the updated Call of Duty Warzone-Zombies-Multiplayer universe, [Activision](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/activision/) confirmed that the Black Ops 6 camo grind will do away with weapon level requirements, letting players start progression on camo challenges from the get-go.

In a chunker of a blog post (which I find [<u>easiest to read on Battle.net</u>](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/24135092/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-global-systems-revealed)), Activision explains the "epic grind to unlock Weapon Camos, including Mastery Camos for Multiplayer, Zombies, and for the first time, a dedicated Camo Challenge system for Call of Duty: Warzone." This post also has a ton of video embeds showing off the different camos, and the CoD sleuths at Modern Warzone stitched a few together in this handy clip:Â 

BREAKING: Black Ops 6 Weapon camos will not have ANY weapon level requirements to begin unlocking them. ðŸŽ‰This means youâ€™ll be able to start earning camos from the moment you first start using a weapon instead or having to level it up to max first before starting the grind. pic.twitter.com/gT3i1hSQoO[August 29, 2024](https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1829196247892381966)

"Veterans of Black Ops should be happy to learn that the way many of the camos are unlocked takes inspiration from previous titles," the post reads. "Each Weaponâ€™s Camo journey is broken up into three categories â€“ featuring a mix of elements from traditional Black Ops Camo Systems of past as well as modern Camo Challenge elements seen in recent titles."Â 

There are three types of weapon camos, each with specialized challenges attached. Here's the simplest breakdown I can manage:

There's more good news for level requirement haters, too. "Players will no longer need to unlock each Weaponâ€™s Optic 'Node' as part of the Weapon Leveling journey," Activision said. "Instead, players will have access to the Optic Attachment Category from Weapon Level 1 and can immediately equip any of their favorite previously unlocked Class Optics when starting out with a new Weapon."
