The Nintendo World Championships kicked off the 90s with a neon flourish, thrusting a three-game NES cartridge into the hands of competing fans. Since then, we’ve had a couple more Championship events aiming to bring super-fans together for individual speed-run tasks. The most recent was in 2017, but I think we all agree the 1990 competition set the tone for the whole affair. 

Nintendo is working hard to bring that competitive spirit back to the Switch this year, with the Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition launching on July 18. The collection brings 13 classic NES titles together across more than 150 different challenges, each contributing to a weekly online leaderboard. You can pre-order the Nintendo World Championships digital version for [<strong>$29.99 at Nintendo</strong>](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch/), but true retro fans will want to see the Deluxe Set. 

Not only does this package include a full golden NES cartridge replica, but you’re getting 13 art cards and five pins. That’s loads of collectible gear for just [<strong>$59.99 at Best Buy</strong>](https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=grd-us-1386923578729993257&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-deluxe-set-nintendo-switch-nintendo-switch-oled-model-nintendo-switch-lite%2F6583885.p&article_name=Calling%20all%20speedrunners%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20World%20Championships%20Deluxe%20Pack%20is%20now%20available%20to%20pre-order&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fplatformer%2Fcalling-all-speedrunners-the-nintendo-world-championships-deluxe-pack-is-now-available-to-pre-order).
