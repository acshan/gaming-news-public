Hello Games is best known for its massively ambitious games about exploration thanks to [No Man’s Sky](https://www.gamesradar.com/no-mans-sky-guide/), and that game has been constantly updated over the years to the point where it’s now so good that you forget how much of a disaster the launch was. The studio’s upcoming game [Light No Fire](https://www.gamesradar.com/light-no-fire-guide/) looks to be just as overwhelmingly massive, with [its reveal at The Game Awards](https://www.gamesradar.com/light-no-fire-is-the-no-mans-sky-devs-blurring-the-lines-between-valheim-death-stranding-and-the-open-adventure-of-lord-of-the-rings/) 2023 giving serious No Man’s Sky reveal trailer vibes. However, for those looking for a nice compact adventure, Hello Games actually released one in between all of this, which just so happens to be one of the steepest discounts in the [Steam Spring Sale](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/steam-sale-guide/).

[The Last Campfire](https://www.gamesradar.com/have-you-tried-solving-puzzles-with-stinky-fruit-treadmills-and-pigs-in-the-last-campfire/) is a delightful little puzzle game released back in 2020 and follows a lost soul named Ember helping out other soul creatures to find their purpose in death – almost like a Spiritfarer (which was released nine days before it), but less emotionally devastating. The game was developed by a small team within Hello Games made up of former Frontier Developments staff who worked on the 2008 WiiWare title LostWinds, so if you remember that, you’ll have a good idea of the vibes on show in The Last Campfire.

While there’s a metric ton of games [on sale for under $5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/all-55-of-these-games-are-under-usd5-in-steam-spring-sale-2025-which-is-just-silly-for-metroidvanias-rpgs-roguelikes-and-more-gems-this-good/) right now, you’ll be able to pick up [The Last Campfire on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/990630/The_Last_Campfire/) for less than $2, with it currently going for $1.49 / £1.27 / AU$2.19 in the Steam Spring Sale 2025. It wont conjure the same feelings as a massive procedurally generated open-world game, but you can drag yourself away from those for a cute 6-hour puzzle adventure, can’t you?

*Another highlight in the Steam Spring Sale 2025 is the [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/)-produced mech banger Zone of the Enders: The Second Runner Mars, which is*[<em> going for less than $6 right now. </em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/one-of-hideo-kojimas-most-overlooked-games-is-under-usd6-in-the-steam-spring-sale-2025-to-make-the-wait-for-death-stranding-2-more-bearable/)
