2024 is already proving particularly lucrative for gaming laptop deals. CES didn't give us too many major component upgrades so last year's RTX 40-Series machines are set to spend another year as the current generation, which means bigger savings for us further down the line. 

You'll find offers across all ends of the spectrum: whether you're looking for one of the [best gaming laptops](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-gaming-laptops-compared/) with some of the MSRP shaved off, or have your heart set on a budget machine for casual experiences, there's likely always a discount that'll be appropriate for what you need.

We've capped our search for cheap gaming laptop deals at a budget of $2,000 / £2,000 and split our findings for those true bargain hunters (under $1,000) and those looking to add a little extra value to their price tag. If you're on the hunt for gaming laptop deals under $1,000, you'll be browsing RTX cards like the RTX 4050 and RTX 4060. Moving a little closer to $2,000 brings you up to RTX 4070 and - if you're lucky - the odd RTX 4080 configurations as well. 

You'll find all our top picks for this week's best cheap gaming laptop deals just below, but if you're after something more permanent we'd also recommend checking out all the latest [cheap gaming PC deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-cheap-gaming-pc-deals-2022/).

Defining a cheap gaming laptop usually comes down to setting a value to the individual parts inside each rig. For example, an RTX 4070 machine with a current-gen i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going to be *cheap *if it's priced around $1,000-$1,500, depending on the chassis itself. However, an RTX 3050 with an i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD would be considered overpriced in this range. 

However, a lot of this determination comes from the brand and model. The [best Razer laptops](https://www.gamesradar.com/razer-laptops/), for example, are particularly well-engineered machines with a whole suite of premium features and display technology. That means a 'cheap gaming laptop deal' on one of these rigs will *still *be a lot more expensive than the average going rate for the specs inside. The same goes for [cheap Alienware laptops](https://www.gamesradar.com/cheap-alienware-laptops/) as well.

It's becoming increasingly rare to find budget gaming laptops at under $500 / £500, though you may still find some offers in this price range hitting the shelves during larger sales events. The rigs behind these price tags will always be incredibly entry level, though - so it might be worth setting your budget a little higher to truly maximise your value. $500 might get you a lot further when put towards an RTX-enabled configuration than it would in a budget GTX buy.

The best budget gaming laptops right now are the Acer Nitro 5, HP Pavilion Gaming, MSI GF63, and Asus TUF Dash F15. These are all rigs that sacrifice some of the fancier features of more premium chassis' to ensure you're getting great components at an affordable rate.
