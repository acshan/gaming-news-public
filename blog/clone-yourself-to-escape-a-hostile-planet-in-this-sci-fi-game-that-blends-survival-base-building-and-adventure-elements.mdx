The Alters is an unconventional blend of survival, adventure, and base-building elements packaged into an emotive sci-fi game set to launch this year.

The story pitch is simple. You play as the sole survivor of an ill-fated space expedition called Jan Dolski, who plans to escape the hostile planet he's trapped on by creating alternative versions of himself to form a new crew.

In a new explainer laying out what The Alters is trying to do at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Spring Showcase, developer 11 bit Studios says balancing all those genres was a top priority during development.

"We wanted the gameplay to push the story forward but also make the narrative play a significant role in the final outcome," the developer says.

11 bit Studios goes on to share that The Alters begins as a traditional survival game, though you get a sense of something more when you need to start duplicating and altering yourself to fill out a crew with varying skills. More characters mean more personalities to manage as you witness the influence on the story unfold.

The elements of base building also start simply before adding more people makes it more complex. A bigger cast means you can get more done, sure, though not everyone agrees on the priorities and where resources are needed the most. As such, it's down to you push the mission forward while making sure everyone's needs are met.

Interested? 11 bit Studios plans to drop more trailers called the 'Expedition Logs' that aim to dive deeper into each facet of gameplay. The Alters is set to launch this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.
