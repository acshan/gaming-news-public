[Starfield](https://www.gamesradar.com/starfield-guide/) players have been begging for vehicles since the open-world RPG first launched, and Xbox boss [Phil Spencer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/phil-spencer/) is no exception. In fact, he was bugging Todd Howard for the feature directly.Â 

In an interview as part of [Xbox's Gamescom stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1Qd1cFr9VY), Spencer said his presence at the event was preventing him from hopping into "my buggy in Starfield. I've been asking Todd for vehicles. 'Come on, Todd, I want vehicles in this game. I'm tired of walking around this planet.' I thought the trailer for that looked really good last night, so I can't wait to drive around planets in Starfield."

The notion of Spencer gently whining "come on, Todd" has very much tickled me, and it seems to have worked - never mind the fact that the entire Starfield community has spent a year doing the same thing. The [Rev-8 update hit Starfield as part of a surprise update](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/starfields-rev-8-update-brings-the-first-ever-drivable-land-vehicle-to-a-bethesda-rpg-and-i-kind-of-want-to-play-starfield-now/) that dropped during [Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/), and it immediately [inspired players to "go GTA" on a poor, unsuspecting New Atlantis](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/starfields-new-space-buggy-vehicle-opens-the-door-to-automotive-crime-as-players-immediately-go-gta-on-new-atlantis/). Hopefully it'll recover before [Starfield's Shattered Space DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/starfield-shattered-space/) launches on September 30.

Elsewhere in his Gamescom interview, Spencer talked about more than just his penchant for annoying Todd Howard. He also noted that [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is coming to PS5 because "it's a strategy that works for us" and "our franchises are getting stronger,"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-ps5-because-its-a-strategy-that-works-for-us-and-our-franchises-are-getting-stronger/) addressing the concerns of long-time Xbox fans about the brand's increasingly multiplatform strategy.

[<em>Kid Stuff is by far the best trait in Starfield, even if it did lead to a deeply embarrassing encounter in a nightclub.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/kid-stuff-is-by-far-the-best-trait-in-starfield-even-if-it-did-lead-to-a-deeply-embarrassing-encounter-in-a-nightclub/)
