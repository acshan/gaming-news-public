[Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) is rapidly expanding its offerings on PC, and part of that push is an effort to get more players signed up for [PlayStation Network](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/playstation-network/). [Helldivers 2 walked back its post-launch plans for a PSN requirement](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-triumph-as-sony-walks-back-psn-account-linking-decision-and-studio-ceo-says-hes-impressed-by-the-willpower-of-the-community/), but Concord - the upcoming 5v5 FPS from a team of Destiny veterans - aims to make PC players sign up with PSN from the start.

According to the devs, Concord's PSN requirement on PC is how features like cross-play and cross-progression can be implemented. "The goal is for players to come together," lead character designer Jon Weisnewski tells [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-developer-discusses-monetisation-psn-account-requirement). "And so for us to have PC players and PlayStation 5 players together, for that cross-play and cross-progression to work, that's a layer that needs to be there - just on a technical level. So the goal is we want to get players together, to have fun and play together, this is part of that experience."

Sony-published PlayStation games have taken a wide array of approaches to PSN following the [intense backlash over Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/ouch-right-in-the-review-score-helldivers-2-boss-responds-to-20000-negative-steam-reviews-sparked-by-sonys-psn-mandate-says-i-guess-its-warranted/). Last month, [Ghost of Tsushima hit PC with a PSN requirement for its online mode](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/helldivers-2-psn-fiasco-forces-ghost-of-tsushima-dev-to-clarify-its-pc-account-linking-plans/), but no requirement to sign up for an account if you want to play solo. But despite being a single-player only game, the upcoming PC version of [God of War Ragnarok is apparently set to require PSN](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/god-of-war-ragnarok-requires-a-playstation-network-account-on-pc-suggesting-that-sony-learned-very-little-from-its-helldivers-2-snafu/) if you want to play at all.

As for Concord, the FPS game's proper unveiling last month met with a mixed reception from a gaming audience fatigued by live service games, but the shooter has plenty of pedigree and potential. A beta is set to kick off in July ahead of the full launch on August 23.
