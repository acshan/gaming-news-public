PlayStation is taking its new hero shooter Concord offline after less than two weeks online.

In an update shared to the [PlayStation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/03/an-important-update-on-concord/), Firewalk Studios game director Ryan Ellis said there are "aspects of the game and our initial launch" that didn't "land the way we'd intended." For that reason, the game is being taken offline on September 6 and refunds will be going out to everyone who purchased the game on PS5 or PC.Â 

"While we determine the best path ahead, Concord sales will cease immediately and we will begin to offer a full refund for all gamers who have purchased the game for PS5 or PC," Ellis said. "If you purchased the game for PlayStation 5 from the PlayStation Store or PlayStation Direct, a refund will be issued back to your original payment method."

After [a whopping eight years in development](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/new-playstation-fps-concord-was-in-development-for-about-8-years-starting-almost-exactly-when-2016s-overwatch-got-hero-shooters-trending/) and a July beta, Concord fully released on PS5 and PC on August 23. We don't know exact player figures since PlayStation keeps that kind of stuff under wraps, but [we know its performance on Steam was utterly abysmal](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/valve-and-sonys-new-hero-shooters-show-the-highs-and-lows-of-live-service-games-as-deadlock-courts-64000-players-and-concord-fails-to-reach-700-on-steam/). Considering it's being taken offline with refunds being given out freely to everyone, it's now pretty darn clear it wasn't doing very well on any platform.

Our own Concord review called the FPS "a hard sell" in its current state and said it makes "a terrible first impression" despite having a solid foundation, a fun class-swapping feature, and impressive visuals. Reviews across the board haven't been stellar, and yet its abrupt un-launching is unprecedented in the modern live-service landscape. PlayStation even had a whole [Concord roadmap](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-roadmap/) planned out that's seemingly being scrapped entirely while we await further news on the game's future.
