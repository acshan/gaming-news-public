Shortly after [revealing a game-changing new character](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/risk-of-rain-2-one-of-our-favorite-roguelikes-is-getting-a-game-changing-character-the-seeker-a-team-reviving-beast-inspired-by-classic-rpg-monks-and-tai-chi/) coming in Risk of Rain 2's Seekers of the Storm DLC, developer and publisher [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/) has pulled the whole curtain back on what's next for one of the [<u>best roguelikes</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-roguelikes-roguelites/) around. Seekers of the Storm is out Tuesday, August 27, it costs $14.99, and it's also adding the long-requested returning character Chef. 

The release of Seekers of the Storm will also mark Risk of Rain 2's official new-gen update. The game has been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X for years, but it's only just now getting "the real deal," as Gearbox puts it in a press release. (Obviously, the DLC is also coming to Switch, just not with a new-gen upgrade.)  

"All current Risk of Rain 2 players on Xbox Series X and PS5 will be upgraded for free and all new players can immediately drop in with the new features such as couch co-op splitscreen, 4K resolution (30FPS), and 60FPS at 1440p and 1080p. Additionally, PlayStation 5 users will have new visual and audio effects available to them via the DualSense Controller." 

Chef, originally released as an unlockable Survivor in the first Risk of Rain, is the star of the show for many. He was very briefly teased during the reveal stream for the Seeker, and I remember seeing Twitch chat explode into a chorus of "CHEEEEEEEEF" at the time. Fortunately, the culinary robot seems to retain his core identity in Risk of Rain 2. Here's his full kit breakdown:
