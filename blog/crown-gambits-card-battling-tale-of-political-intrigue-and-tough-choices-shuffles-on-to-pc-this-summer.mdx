The all new trailer for Crown Gambit, revealed at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/), has a announced a Summer 2025 release date for its innovative blend of card battles and rich narrative storytelling. This interesting mix of tactical card combat and political turmoil will see you pledge allegiance to a contender to the throne in a dark fantasy world, and then deal with the consequences of the choices you make to bring them to power.

Crown gambit takes place in the kingdom of Meodred, where a fragile balance of power sees its throne at the heart of a complex and twisted battle for power. Playing as three paladins, it's up to you to choose a side and then put them on the throne by whatever means possible.

This battle for power plays out through deck building card battles against a complex story full of morally dubious choices, political chaos, treachery and conspiracy. You'll need to choose your allies wisely, while playing off your enemy's various rivalries to win.

At the heart of this are your three heroes, Aliza, a swordswoman, Hael, a mace-wielding cleric and Rollo the rogue. Each character will require strategic deck preparation to make the best use of their unique abilities, and combine their powers, as they fight everything from spies to traitors, nobles and even dark spirits. To aid you, you'll also have the power of your Ancestral Grace to call on, to access devastating attacks to that can turn the tide of battle, but at what cost?

You'll be able to test your mettle and honor in Crown Gambit when the game comes to PC and Mac on Steam and GOG this summer.
