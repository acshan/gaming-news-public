Cult of the Lamb fans have been hit with "a dose of reality" by the roguelike game's Twitter community manager, who's compared the indie hit to Animal Crossing in a way that's in equal parts hilarious and truly painful. 

Over on Twitter yesterday, the official Cult of the Lamb Twitter account shared a new parody animation from [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) channel 64 Bits, which reimagines Nintendo's adorable cozy life sim series Animal Crossing – transforming it into something which looks and feels much more akin to Massive Monster's roguelike. Obviously, in reality, the indie plays very differently to the likes of Animal Crossing: New Horizons – they reside in totally separate genres, after all – but hey, you still get to live alongside a bunch of animal buddies, so that's something, right?

The team behind the indie clearly thinks so, anyway, as the official account responds to the animation, saying: "We're just like Animal Crossing!" However, there's a caveat, and one that might hit a bit too close to home for many. "Except our game is more realistic, since you can't buy a house." *Ouch*. 

We're just like Animal Crossing! Except our game is more realistic, since you can't buy a house. https://t.co/mrJCFddkGt[October 31, 2024](https://twitter.com/cultofthelamb/status/1851975817737224614)

Basking in the chaos of the replies this tweet prompted, with some joking that it was [<u>"uncalled for,"</u>](https://x.com/duskshadowbrony/status/1851990693687787557) the community manager simply doubles down further. "They told me to tweet something scary for Halloween, so I hit you with a dose of reality," they explain. 

Cult of the Lamb's Twitter account has always been a bit of a wild place, to say the least. Last year, the devs used it to proclaim that [<u>"we will add sex to the game if we hit 300k followers by the end of the year."</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/cult-of-the-lamb-signs-itself-up-for-a-sex-update-after-underestimating-the-thirst-of-the-roguelikes-community/) This goal was hit in a matter of hours thanks to the thirst of the roguelike's community, and [<u>Massive Monster really did deliver in the Sins of the Flesh update</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/cult-of-the-lambs-sex-update-launches-next-week-with-a-new-progression-system-and-shiny-poops/) which launched a couple of months later and added the Mating Tent. I mean, fair play to the team for actually sticking to its word – I'm not sure anyone was expecting the devs to take it seriously.
