While [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) still lives rent-free in the forefront of players' minds, the director behind Cyberpunk 2 - Cyberpunk 2078, or whatever the [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-guide/) sequel ends up being called - can't stop thinking about and playing Baldur's Gate 2.

When asked about his most-played game of all time in an interview clip with [PC Gamer](https://x.com/pcgamer/status/1808938831816589320), [CD Projekt Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/) game director Pawel Sasko cites Baldur's Gate 2 as the RPG that kickstarted his interest in development since he's finished the game to completion about "five or six times altogether from scratch with multiple characters, multiple ways."

"I love Baldur's Gate 1 and 2," Sasko says. "It was the game that really made me want to get into game dev and really make my own games." Sasko goes on to do some mental maths, calculating that if "one playthrough was like 300 hours" and he did "like five or six altogether," then his overall playtime would probably surpass a whopping 1,500 hours. 

[How Long To Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/809) - the website that estimates, y'know, how long it takes to beat a game - guesses that an average Baldur's Gate 2: Enhanced Edition playthrough could take anywhere from 45 hours, if you're just focusing on main story stuff, to 150 hours for a completionist run. Sasko's estimated playtime doubles the average player's completionist route, so I guess he really, really takes his time clicking around.

Details on the Cyberpunk sequel are still relatively light, but we do know that the project is retaining most of the first game's senior developers to ["preserve" the RPG's DNA](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-is-being-intensively-worked-on-but-cyberpunk-2-is-keeping-most-of-its-senior-devs-to-preserve-the-rpgs-dna/). Baldur's Gate 2 will probably also have some invisible influences on Cyberpunk 2, but for those of you who like your RPGs of the isometric, fantasy variety, [D&D owner Hasbro says it's already taking the next steps](https://www.gamesradar.com/dandd-owner-hasbro-is-already-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-the-next-baldurs-gate-game-and-hopes-its-not-another-25-years-before-it-comes-out/) to move toward a Baldur's Gate 4.
