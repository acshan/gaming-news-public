As the mastermind developers behind games like [<u>Danganronpa</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/danganronpa-trigger-happy-havoc/) and Zero Escape prepare to release The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, co-director Kotaro Uchikoshi reveals that the new tactical RPG features 100 carefully crafted endings.

Fans of visual novel-esque gems like Danganronpa and The Nonary Games understand the concept of choice-driven endings well, but The Hundred Line takes things to the next level by offering players a whopping 100 potential finales. As translated by [<u>Automaton</u>](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academys-100-endings-are-all-dense-enough-to-be-true-endings-with-no-fillers-or-easy-bad-endings-says-kotaro-uchikoshi/), Uchikoshi explains how he worked on the branching storylines in a recent [<u>post</u>](https://hundred-line.com/special/blog/detail/?p=12) online, laying out the "extreme" conditions that were in place as he designed endings.

First and foremost, each of the 100 endings had to have "meaning" – that means they all need to be "dense," as Uchikoshi also wanted to avoid any "easy" bad finales seen in most visual novels and decision-dependent narratives (I'm looking at you, Knife ending in 999). He says every ending needed to feel genuine and not like a bonus scenario or spin-off. As for what would constitute the "true" ending, Uchikoshi writes it's intentionally left up to the player.

The main route exists, but it's not necessarily the "true" route. The co-director wanted every ending to feel fleshed out enough to stand on its own as a "true" ending, should the player consider it as such. The Hundred Line's paths might also feel wildly different depending on a person's choices along the way, straying into separate genres ranging from drama or sci-fi to mystery or romance. It's big, to say the least – but that's how the creators envisioned it.

In fact, fellow lead Kazutaka Kodaka previously admitted that the tactical RPG is so long, [<u>devs worried it might "put off" players</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/after-going-into-debt-to-make-it-danganronpa-lead-worries-his-strategy-rpg-has-too-much-content-when-games-are-too-long-players-can-get-put-off-so-were-trying-not-to-talk-about-it-too-much/). Uchikoshi's words seem to support as much, as he describes how he chose to "ride the wave of madness" while constructing the game's branching paths and endings, each one as content-heavy as the last. He concludes by urging fans to "play through every corner" of The Hundred Line – advice I fear I'll take too seriously myself as an achievement hunter.*While you wait for The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy to release, check out a few of the *[<u><em>best JRPGs</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-jrpgs/)* to try right now.*
