Dark and Darker Mobile, the portable version of the hit extraction RPG, is bringing high stakes fantasy gaming to your phone.

Developed by Bluehole Studio using the expertise of PUBG: Battlegrounds publisher Krafton, Dark and Darker Mobile is a PvEvP experience where players explore dungeons, fight monsters, collect treasure, and strive to escape before other players can take their prize away from them. Set in a medieval low fantasy world, executive producer Joonseok Ahn explains that "my favorite aspect of Dark and Darker Mobile is the natural fusion of various genres." The game combines "dungeon extraction with elements of battle royale, dungeon crawler, and RPG genres" to ensure that "players will constantly face new challenges and reap rewards along the way." And it's all available on the go.

Simply surviving in the dungeon isn't enough - in Dark and Darker Mobile, you need to thrive. As you fight your way through as one of the game's six classes - the strong Fighter or Barbarian, the sneakier Ranger and Rogue, or the magical Cleric and Wizard - Escape Portals will appear randomly, allowing players to warp out to safety with the loot they've collected. But before you can do that, you'll need to contend with the monsters that live in the dungeon, the other players that are also striving to find gold and glory within its walls, and the dangerous Darkswarm system that's pushing you ever further into the labyrinth. Thankfully, multiplayer means that you can form a party of up to three players, tackling the dungeon together and using the class system to give yourself the greatest advantage possible - even across the game's four different difficulty levels.

To ensure the best possible experience on mobile, developer Bluehole Studio has made sure to adjust the most hardcore elements of the extraction genre to fit mobile gaming. Complex, physics-based combat mechanics that Ahn makes Dark and Darker Mobile "feel like a console game" make use of easy-to-use touch controls, and the developers have been working hard to ensure smooth performance across a wide range of mobile devices. "Using Unreal Engine 5.2.1," Ahn explains, "we've created highly realistic dungeon environments, dynamic lighting, and detailed character models."Â 

The game makes sure to bring that visual fidelity to the audio experience too, ensuring that "the sound of footsteps in the dungeon, the clash of metal weapons, and the menacing war of the Darkswarm are all rendered with incredible realism." The mobile version also features more interactive environments to add a strategic edge to combat and survival, as well as an AI mercenary system and other tools to improve multiplayer. "You'll need to consider the weight of your weapon and your movement within the confined spaces of the dungeon," Ahn says, explaining that Bluehole Studio has "meticulously planned and developed combat" to ensure that the experience is "truly immersive." Even on smaller screens, the team has focused on "maintaining the depth and complexity of the extraction RPG genre."

Dark and Darker Mobile is expected to launch on both iOS and Android devices - with pre-registration available now - but release won't mean the end for the game's development. Post-launch updates will feature new dungeons, classes, and items, and Bluehole Studio says it will keep a close eye on player feedback to continue improving the game.
