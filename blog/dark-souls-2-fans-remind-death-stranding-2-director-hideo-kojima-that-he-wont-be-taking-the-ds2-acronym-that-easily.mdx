Death Stranding 2 director [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/) seems to be in good spirits after revealing the game's June 26 [release date](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hideo-kojima-reveals-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-and-the-collectors-edition-includes-exactly-what-i-predicted-it-would/) in a [combat-heavy trailer](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hideo-kojima-aims-to-beat-the-walking-simulator-allegations-as-death-stranding-2-releases-combat-heavy-trailer/) shown at SXSW this weekend, cheerily discussing game moments that will make you ["probably throw the controller"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hideo-kojima-says-hell-apologize-beforehand-for-death-stranding-2-moments-with-troy-bakers-higgs-which-are-so-ridiculous-that-youll-probably-throw-the-controller/) and his behind the scenes desires about needing ["an actor who 'would surpass' Mads Mikkelsen"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hideo-kojima-says-he-chose-death-stranding-2s-solid-snake-lookalike-because-he-needed-an-actor-who-would-surpass-mads-mikkelsen/) with fans on Twitter. Kojima's getting more personal, and he's even gotten comfortable with calling Death Stranding 2 by the affectionate nickname DS2 – though, Dark Souls 2 fans may want him to reign that in.

"How was the DS2 trailer?" Kojima [asks on Twitter](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1898863087626891589) after Death Stranding 2's SXSW showcase.

"It was good, feels like just yesterday," says [the top reply](https://x.com/SneedPlays/status/1898866909493498325). "Dark Souls 2 is the best Dark Souls."

"I love DS2," [retorts another popular comment](https://x.com/FromSoftUpdates/status/1899066643558404605), tacking on an image of Dark Souls 2's Bearer of the Curse protagonist looking mysterious and war-worn.

Another fan chastises Kojima: "Don't you dare using that acronym for Walking Simulator 2."

In Kojima's defense, Death Stranding 2's most recent trailer – if you're willing to watch past the mechanical baby – demonstrates machine gun fire and kaiju stomping, which you probably wouldn't get involved in on a more typical stroll through the neighborhood.

But [Dark Souls 2's trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-dcwB3qTMA) from 2012 is, admittedly, more spartan in nature. It doesn't bother with long talks and meaningful kisses like Death Stranding 2; it begins with blood spilling quietly over the Bearer's gauntlets and ends in a sudden blast of dragon's breath to the face.

It's pretty medievally awesome, but, [as one fan informs Hideo Kojima](https://x.com/TheBuschaloman/status/1898884416165855673), "Dark Souls 2 trailer was nothing like the actual game." Our GamesRadar+ [Dark Souls 2 review](https://www.gamesradar.com/dark-souls-2-review/) disagrees, but I'd even say that the [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) game is by far the worst in the Dark Souls trilogy.

So, in this battle for the perfect acronym, may the best DS2 win.
