One of the many PlayStation games to cameo in the hot new platformer on the block Astro Bot is Days Gone, though how neat that is seemingly differs depending on which of the game's developers you ask.

"Astro Bot is a masterpiece!" [says](https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1832569600782774696) Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister. "Such a well-designed, creative, and polished experience that brings me so much joy. Thank you again, Team Asobi, for including Days Gone into your wonderful game. Our team is incredibly honored. Please go play it and say hi to Deacon for me."

McAllister's sentiment echos that of the [official Bend Studio account](https://x.com/BendStudio/status/1832041080327634971), though not so much Days Gone's now departed director and writer John Garvin.

"Kinda sad that Deek has been reduced to promoting other games … well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!" he [says](https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1832243904172978646) before a back-and-forth with several fans, including the [following response](https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1832253308570104117) to one telling him to calm down: "I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill promoting some small game and I’m being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking."

[Garvin initially left Bend Studio](https://www.gamesradar.com/days-gone-writer-and-director-both-leave-sony-bend-studio/) sometime after Days Gone's release, eventually announcing as much on Twitter over a year later. Since then, Garvin and the studio have appeared at odds here and there. On one occasion, Garvin put the post-apocalyptic game's [poor reception](https://www.reddit.com/r/DaysGone/comments/zfbssk/director_john_garvin_made_a_really_stupid_tweet/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) on bugs, critics who didn't play the game, and the "woke reviewers" who did, prompting [the studio to release a statement](https://x.com/BendStudio/status/1600944632409755648) distancing itself from the view.

As for Days Gone 2, that doesn't look like happening anytime soon. While game director and [fellow Bend Studio alumni Jeff Ross has teased what could have been](https://www.gamesradar.com/days-gone-2-would-have-had-better-tech-and-a-more-dynamic-open-world/), the [studio maintains that it's working on something new](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/days-gone-studios-dev-reiterates-new-ip-plans-says-its-not-fair-to-fans-to-be-continuously-getting-fed-false-hope-and-poor-information-about-sequels/) and that it's "not fair to fans" to be "continuously getting fed false hope and poor information."

*We're not stopping there, either.
