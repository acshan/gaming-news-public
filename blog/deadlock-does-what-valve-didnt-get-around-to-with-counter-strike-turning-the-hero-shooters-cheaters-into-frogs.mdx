A new [<u>Deadlock</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/moba/valve-finally-lifts-the-lid-on-the-overwatch-meets-dota-hero-shooter-everyone-already-knew-it-was-making/) update has arrived, and its approach to anti-cheat measures is one-of-a-kind - the shooter will now let players choose to turn any cheater into a literal frog.

Thanks to its "anti-cheat detection system," Deadlock leaves every cheater's fate in opposing players' hands. If someone dares to cheat, opponents will be given two options - they can either instantly ban the guilty player, or they can opt for something far funnier. They can turn them into a frog for the remainder of the match. Right now, [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/) says the system is just "set to conservative detection levels."

The team is still working on "a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive," but fans love it already - as do Valve veterans themselves. Speaking in a [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/sptonjohn/status/1839477885582905651) on Deadlock's unique anti-cheat measures, former [<u>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/) developer Burton Johnsey reveals that the company's older iconic shooter almost featured a similar system. "Holy crap, they finally built codename 'FU Surprise Mode'?!"

Holy crap, they finally built codename “FU Surprise Mode”?! When I worked on VAC, Rich and I designed this for CS but the cheater was a chicken. https://t.co/Q6BKGTCZwj[September 27, 2024](https://twitter.com/sptonjohn/status/1839477885582905651)

He continues: "When I worked on VAC, Rich and I designed this for CS but the cheater was a chicken." That's right, CS stans - the community could've had anti-cheat chickens. While it probably won't happen in [<u>Counter-Strike 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/counter-strike-2-guide/), Deadlock at least has frogs. They aren't the only thing to come to Valve's hero shooter with its recent [<u>update</u>](https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/15843158/), either - new hero Mirage has arrived as have various smaller changes.
