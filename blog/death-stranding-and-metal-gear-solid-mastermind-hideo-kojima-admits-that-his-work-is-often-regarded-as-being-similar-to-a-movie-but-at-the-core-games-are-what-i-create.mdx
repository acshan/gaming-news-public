Despite many of his games being viewed as cinematic masterpieces of sorts, [<u>Hideo Kojima</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/) says that's not necessarily his intention - but he does also hope to open up a "a new dimension" of film adaptations with projects like the [<u>Death Stranding movie</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hideo-kojima-says-the-death-stranding-movie-is-not-just-a-direct-translation-of-the-game-will-show-a-universe-that-has-never-been-seen-before/).

Speaking to [<u>Variety</u>](https://variety.com/lists/variety-10-gaming-entertainment-leaders/vicki-dobbs-beck/) as one of its crowned Entertainment Gaming Leaders, Kojima explains that video games have always been the "core" of his work. "My work is often regarded as being similar to a movie," says the renowned lead, "but at the core, games are what I create." He isn't only interested in games, however - the director also has an appreciation for film, as can be seen through his upcoming project [<u>OD</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/od-overdose-hideo-kojima-xbox-guide/).

The mysterious new game he describes as [<u>"a bit risky" and "a game like no other"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-says-the-choice-to-create-something-new-that-wasnt-death-stranding-with-od-is-a-bit-risky-as-its-a-game-like-no-other/) is being produced in collaboration with comedian and filmmaker Jordan Peele, after all. Kojima also has the [<u>Death Stranding</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding/) movie up his sleeve, and according to him, he'll ensure it stands as a different on-screen adaptation than any to come before it: "I aim to present a new dimension of cinematic adaptation that goes beyond merely turning a game into a live-action movie."

Even though Kojima is only participating in the film adaptation in a supervisory role with the arthouse distributor, it sounds as though he's aiming sky-high - an unsurprising revelation, considering his work on iconic titles like [<u>Metal Gear</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/metal-gear/). There's more to come from Kojima than just OD and the Death Stranding movie, too - [<u>Death Stranding 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-2-guide/) is also currently in the works and is set to release sometime in 2025.
