[Destiny 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/)'s latest big update, Into the Light, launched with a hardcore horde mode called Onslaught that at least one member of the development team thought would be impossible for a solo player to complete. You can probably guess where this is going: somebody has already soloed Onslaught on its highest difficulty.

That someone is a French player who goes by the name Xeneris. Overnight, they [<u>tweeted</u>](https://twitter.com/Xeneris_V/status/1779757148374786488) the results screen for the "World first solo onslaught legend." You can check out the stats readout below - 90 minutes, 1676 kills, and all 50 waves cleared. It doesn't look like there's a video of the clear available yet, but members of the dev team at [Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/bungie/) are already offering congratulations.

When Onslaught was first detailed, [associate designer Noah Lee reckoned that it would be "impossible" to solo](https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2s-new-onslaught-mode-looks-like-the-call-of-duty-zombies-style-horde-mode-the-mmo-has-always-been-perfect-for-and-bungie-thinks-its-impossible-to-solo/). "I'll never underestimate this playerbase again," Lee [tweeted](https://twitter.com/BlazingMuffinz/status/1779798747905736714) in response to Xeneris's accomplishment. "I hereby bestow the ultimate honor, you're That Guy." And, indeed, Xeneris has taken that moniker with pride, making it a part of their Twitter profile.

Into the Light is a sort of stopgap content update intended to help fill the final months leading up to the long-awaited [Destiny 2: The Final Shape](https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guide/) expansion. On top of Onslaught, it's also [brought back some of the most broken guns in the MMO's history, though Bungie has asserted they're a bit less broken now](https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2-is-bringing-back-some-of-the-most-broken-guns-in-the-mmos-history-but-bungie-says-theyre-less-broken-now/).
