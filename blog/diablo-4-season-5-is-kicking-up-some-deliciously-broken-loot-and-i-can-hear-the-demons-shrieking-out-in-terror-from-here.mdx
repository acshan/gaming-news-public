It looks like Diablo 4 Season 5 is open season for finding some gnarly loot, and, oh dear, I suddenly feel the pull of the action RPG way harder than before.

[Diablo 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4-guide/)'s latest season kicked off last week, introducing a new wave-based rogue-lite mode called Infernal Hordes, more Uniques, and quality-of-life tweaks. While you can get loot by all of those means, one change has long seemed king; you can now [re-summon endgame bosses without having to reset their dungeons](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-has-re-playable-bosses-and-that-means-the-loot-is-already-off-the-charts/). Consider that you can chop 'em down in seconds with a broken-enough build and you've got a pretty good loot-farming strategy there, friend.

We're not so much here to discuss how people are getting their loot â€“ though it helps â€“ but more so what they're getting. And truly, there's something for everyone. You've got swords with enough power to make a loot piÃ±ata sob, helmets that make ability cooldowns nearly non-existent, and more. You can check out some highlights below.

Naturally, plenty of what we're benefiting from is thanks to Season 4 â€“ [dubbed Loot Reborn for a reason.](https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4s-season-4-loot-overhaul-is-so-big-that-it-warrants-a-new-test-server-9-months-after-launch/) The changes were so plentiful and wide-reaching that they necessitated Blizzard introducing Diablo 4's first PTR, a helpful feedback forum that returned for Season 5.

The grand loot rush is, hopefully, a good sign of what's to come in the [Diablo 4 DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4-dlc/) this year. While we've got a new class, area, and story continuation, the general mechanics of everything else should hopefully be relatively the same. We can only hope that means more good loot.
