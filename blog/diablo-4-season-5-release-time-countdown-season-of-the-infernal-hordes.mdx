The Diablo 4 Season 5 release time is nearly here, offering us some more goblin loot-popping fun until Vessel of Hatred releases later in the year.

If you're wondering just how big the upcoming expansion is set to be, [Blizzard's patch notes racked up 10,000 words](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-4-season-5-patch-notes-are-here-and-even-at-over-10000-words-blizzard-still-missed-stuff-out/) – and even then, the developer missed some stuff out. Highlights include [a new roguelite mode and boss](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-patch-notes-reveal-a-new-endgame-roguelite-mode-and-boss-new-uniques-and-massive-quality-of-life-changes-like-re-playable-bosses/) alongside new Uniques. It's not all new stuff, though – [plenty of bosses are now replayable](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/diablo-4-season-5-ptr-has-re-playable-bosses-and-that-means-the-loot-is-already-off-the-charts/) to help with item farming, and we've seen so many changes to current Uniques that the [patch notes essentially include a before and after](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-4-season-5-patch-notes-are-so-big-theyll-have-a-before-and-after-for-all-uniques-because-there-are-changes-to-nearly-every-single-one/) as "there are changes to nearly every single one." Lovely stuff.

The better news is that Diablo 4 Season 5 - Season of the Infernal Hordes, to give it its full name - is nearly here. After hosting a PTR and taking in all the feedback, it's soon time to play the finished and polished result. Here's when Diablo 4 Season 5 will be released in your time zone.

Beyond Season 5, the [Diablo 4 DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4-dlc/), Vessel of Hatred, is due to launch on October 8, 2024. Alongside a new area and continuation of the main story, you've got the first new mainline class in 10 years. To learn more about that, we [spoke to Blizzard about creating something new](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/inside-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-and-the-series-first-new-mainline-class-in-10-years-maybe-i-can-mix-my-barbarian-and-rogue-together/) while offering fans the feeling of mixing up what they already know.
