[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) - that wee game that you might have heard about after its award-winning, chart-topping ascent last year - put all eyes on developer Larian Studios, but despite such a massively successful game under his belt, Larian CEO and founder Swen Vincke reckons an earlier RPG is still the "highlight" of his career.

Before Baldur's Gate 3 made the studio a household name, two crowdfunded Divinity: Original Sin games are what opened the door to for the D&D RPG to exist in the first place. "The highlight of my career so far was most likely the release of Divinity: Original Sin one, which was our first breakthrough hit, because that changed everything for us," Vincke said in an interview with BAFTA.

"If I would have to pick one, I would probably pick the release of Divinity: Original Sin because it was really a sense of relief - finally, we managed, after all these years, we managed to break through," he continued. "We [could] now start doing the things that we really wanted to do all this time. That's probably my favourite one."

Vincke doesn't brush aside the sweeping success of Baldur's Gate 3 either, though. "Obviously winning the BAFTAs, winning The Game Awards, this entire year has been insane, so there were many, many highlights," he said, selling himself a little short since [Baldur's Gate 3 was actually the first game to ever grab gold in all major game award ceremonies](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-passes-elden-ring-and-breath-of-the-wild-to-become-first-game-to-win-all-five-major-goty-awards/#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203-,Baldur's%20Gate%203%20passes%20Elden%20Ring%20and%20Breath%20of%20the,all%20five%20major%20GOTY%20awards&text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20continues%20its,Game%20of%20the%20Year%20awards.). 

It would be easy to just build on the hype with a Baldur's Gate 4, but the company announced that it was done with the D&D license and was hammering away at an all-new RPG. Though, [some developers are apparently finding it hard to create something totally new](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/larian-studios-is-finding-it-hard-to-make-an-rpg-that-feels-totally-new-because-we-did-a-lot-of-things-in-baldurs-gate-3/) because, it turns out, they "did a lot of things in Baldur's Gate 3."
