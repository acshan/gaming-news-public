Xbox has set a Doom: The Dark Ages release date for May 15, 2025. The launch was confirmed during the [Xbox Developer Direct 2025](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/xbox-developer-direct-2025-live-all-of-the-latest-xbox-news-from-the-big-showcase/) stream, where developer id Software was on-hand with an expansive look at the game in action and the details on some of the biggest changes. 

The multi-platform release means that the long-awaited sequel to 2020's Doom Eternal will be one of the first titles from an internal Xbox studio to launch simultaneously for Xbox Series X and PS5, alongside PC and entrance into Game Pass. This is all part of [Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/)'s emerging strategy to launch its titles on rival platforms – with [Grounded, Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment making the jump last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-is-expanding-its-multiplatform-strategy-but-i-wish-it-had-arrived-soon-enough-to-save-halo-infinite/).

Where Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal were focused on an unrelenting push-forward approach to combat, [Doom: The Dark Ages](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-guide/) is built around the concept of stand and fight – wielding a mediaeval arsenal to battle against bigger hordes of marauding demons than ever before. There's wider playspaces, more reactive Glory kills, a suite of new weapons, and the ability to parry monstrous foes with a shield that doubles as a chainsaw… *you know*, everything you want from a new Doom game. 

The decision to simultaneously launch Doom: The Dark Ages on Xbox and PlayStation – rather than stagger the launch, as we're seeing with [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-game-ps5/) (scheduled to land at some point in 2025)  – was confirmed at the Xbox Showcase in 2024. At the time, [<u>Xbox head Phil Spencer told IGN</u>](https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-briefly-explains-the-decision-to-bring-doom-the-dark-ages-to-playstation-5-ign-live-2024): "Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms… It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with [Marty Stratton, id Software studio director] a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that."
