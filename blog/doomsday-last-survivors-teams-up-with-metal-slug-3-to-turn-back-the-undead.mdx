Zombie survival strategy game Doomsday: Last Survivors is teaming up with Metal Slug 3 for a limited time collaboration offering in-game events and rewards, as well as chances to win amazing prizes via the special event website.

In an apocalyptic future where zombies have taken over, in Doomsday: Last Survivors it's your job as Commander to fight for your life - and the future of humanity. Build shelters, explore, and fight off both zombies and rival factions. Thankfully, with this new collaboration with Metal Slug 3, you've got a few new tools at your disposal to help give you the edge.



The partnership kicks off on September 2, with the arrival of Metal Slug warriors Marco & Eri as a new hero. This dynamic duo is fighting as one this time around, and you'll be able to participate in their trial to win exclusive rewards. Marco & Eri will task players with clearing stages, granting challenge points for each stage cleared using assigned warriors with their own strengths and weaknesses. As you earn more challenge points, you'll be able to exchange them for in-game prizes. Elsewhere, you'll also be able to take part in the puzzle event, granting medals which can be exchanged for collaboration cosmetics.



While the collaboration continues, you'll also be able to take it outside the game, thanks to a [<u>special event website</u>](https://dls.igg.com/metalslug3/). There, you'll be able to invite new players to the game, where they can participate in exclusive missions as part of the Doomsday Challenge. Both new players and those who invited them will get rewards based on the progress of the new arrivals. The Metal Slug 3 Collab Homecoming Event means that it's not just new players who are reaping the rewards - inactive players can come back too, teaming up with friends to complete missions, with a chance for both of you to win an Amazon Gift Card as a reward. And if you like the sound of that, then you'll also be able to play the Metal Slug 3 Collab Lucky Cards event, where you'll have the chance to flip cards for rewards each day, with a top prize of a $500 Amazon gift Card.

Doomsday: Last Survivors is available to download and play via [<u>iOS</u>](https://g.igg.com/xftIWW) and [<u>Android</u>](https://g.igg.com/xftIWW), as well as via its official [<u>standalone PC version</u>](https://g.igg.com/xftIWW). To keep up with the game, you can check out its official [<u>Facebook page</u>](https://www.facebook.com/DoomsdayLastSurvivors), or join its [<u>Discord server</u>](https://discord.gg/doomsdaylastsurvivors).
