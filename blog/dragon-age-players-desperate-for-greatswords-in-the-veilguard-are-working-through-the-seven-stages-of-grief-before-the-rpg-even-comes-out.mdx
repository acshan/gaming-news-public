Before you read any further, I want you to grab a tissue. Okay. You're now ready to hear that [<u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/) doesn't seem to have any greatswords in it. 

[BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/)'s new RPG — which launches October 31 — has fulfilling combat and a satisfying story about you, the protagonist, once again defending the lush continent Thedas from evil. We said as much in our [Dragon Age: The Veilguard review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/). And that's all great, but it's not a great*sword*. 

Fans started worrying about the two-handed warrior weapon about a month ago, after [hands-on previews for The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview/) came out at the end of September. 

"Has anyone seen any footage of a warrior Rook using a greatsword in The Veilguard?" asked one nervous [<u>Reddit post</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1fkzvdb/no_datv_spoilers_greatswords_in_veilguard/). "I combed through a few different preview videos, and I didn't see any greatswords at all."

After that, other people started getting paranoid. "When you're excited for Veilguard, but notice the suspicious lack of greatsword gameplay," one highly upvoted Reddit [<u>post says</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gajzsu/no_dav_spoilers_when_youre_excited_for_veilguard/). "I'm not the only one who noticed, right?"

But it wasn't until recently that things got really bad. After posting his own [<u>review</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNx8G5Z0qqU), YouTuber Norzza told fans in his comments section that "there are no greatswords," accompanied by a very forlorn emoji. We haven't seen a trace of greatswords either, so they're either abnormally well-hidden for heaping hunks of metal, or there's been some sort of greatsword buyback since Inquisition. By my count, fans are at the anger stage of grief. 

"[<u>First they came for</u>](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/first-they-came) the dual-wielding warriors, and I was told to shut up because they didn't like dual-wielding warriors," says one popular [<u>Reddit comment</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1geftg8/comment/lua6exd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). "Now they've come for the Greatswords." All right, everyone needs to calm down. This would all be a lot easier if we just accept it.
