[Dragon Age 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/), or what was once [Dragon Age](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/dragon-age/): Dreadwolf, has now been re-dubbed Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and although a multiplayer component was in consideration at one point, it's now been confirmed as a purely single-player, story-focused game.

The Dragon Age series was a strictly single-player RPG until the most recent mainline entry, 2014's Dragon Age Inquisition, added a four-player co-op mode. Although the next Dragon Age game was revealed several years ago, it's never been clear whether it would iterate on Inquisition's multiplayer mode or, God forbid, go full-on live-service. Now, we know for sure that Veilguard is a wholly single-player experience.

"After Dragon Age: Inquisition launched, the studio was given an incredible opportunity to explore, test, and validate a variety of gameplay concepts as we worked to determine what the next Dragon Age could look like," says Gary McKay, [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) general manager and Dragon Age executive product, in [the announcement](https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/) of the title change. 

"We brought everything to the table which, yes, even included a multiplayer concept. The time we spent experimenting and iterating gradually taught us a lot. This work, and the amazing support from EA, helped us re-focus on creating an incredible single-player game with all the choices, characters, and world-building you’d expect from us."

Project director Michael Gamble also took to Twitter to clear up any remaining confusion about Dragon Age: The Veilguard, confirming in no uncertain terms that it's a single-player game. Big 'say it louder for the people in the back' energy going on here.

Some takes out there about this game being a live service game or something like that.That part is in the articles. It ain't. Its straight up single player story goodness.[June 6, 2024](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1798740424779297254)

In the same blog post, BioWare also revealed that, at long last, we're getting some official gameplay on June 11 at 8am PDT/11am EDT/4 pm BST - less than a week away. The showcase will include 15 minutes of gameplay from the beginning of the game, which will take players back to Thedas for a new standalone story featuring a new lead character and a cast of companions.
