Morrigan has finally been confirmed for [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/) in [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/)'s latest trailer, but some fans have realized there might be more to her return.

Yesterday, [BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard's leaked release date](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaks-online-right-before-its-official-reveal/) with a brand new trailer, which featured a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance from none other than Morrigan, everyone's favorite goth swamp witch. As you can see from the tweets below, Morrigan's loyal fans are absolutely head over heels for the witch's return, once again.

OH MY GOD SHE AGED LIKE FINE WINE , MORRIGAN IS BACK #DragonAge pic.twitter.com/O1w8TDN9mn[August 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/RenMods/status/1824115805904109771)

Morrigan Dragon Age my beloved!!#DragonAge pic.twitter.com/xtkwLFfMJu[August 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/blightedart/status/1824120983411908766)

However, there might be more to Morrigan's return than first meets the eye. The Twitter user below has realized that Morrigan is wearing Flemeth's headpiece, which honestly leads to more questions than answers. Arguably chief among them is the mystery of what's actually happened to Flemeth to lead her headpiece to land squarely atop Morrigan's head.

Morrigan is wearing Flemethâ€™s headpiece Iâ€™m going to SOB!! #dragonage pic.twitter.com/ZZXqXjijdP[August 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/spacedogclaire/status/1824117789172342939)

Hold up... what if Morrigan is giving such Mythal vibes because.. it actually IS Mythal! ðŸ‘€ I mean...#Morrigan #Mythal #DragonAge #DAV #DragonAgeVeilguard pic.twitter.com/pwzZwYBKfd[August 16, 2024](https://twitter.com/ThedasWolves/status/1824351727081914686)

Some fans suspect that Morrigan might actually be Flemeth herself, or at least has absorbed a part of Flemeth, which is pretty darn wild if true. Alternatively, some suspect this takes place after Morrigan drinks from the Well of Sorrows in [Dragon Age](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/dragon-age/): Inquisition (if you let her), and thus has bound herself to the will of Mythal. Yeah, it's all pretty convoluted stuff.Â 

Thankfully, there's not that long to wait until we find out what the deal is with Morrigan, because Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases on October 31 across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, [The Veilguard will cost you $70 on consoles and $60 on PC](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-costs-dollar70-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-but-only-dollar60-on-pc/), and there's also [a $150 collector's edition for the new Dragon Age game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-is-dollar150-and-it-doesnt-even-come-with-the-game/) which doesn't even come with the game itself.Â
