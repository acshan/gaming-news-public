After confirming the leaked [<u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard release date</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-leaks-online-right-before-its-official-reveal/), [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) and EA unveiled a smattering of editions, bonuses, and swag coming with the long-awaited RPG, and boy is there a lot. 

We've certainly seen more confounding DLC and deluxe edition charts, but there's a lot of capital-S Stuff trailing [<u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/), per [BioWare's latest blog post](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/release-date-preorders). Let's start with the basics. The standard edition of the game costs $69.99 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, and $59.99 on PC. The deluxe edition, which comes with 23 total cosmetics for Rook and companions, tacks on an extra $20. That's six weapons and three armor sets for Rook plus weapons and armor for seven companions. If you pre-order either edition, you'll also get the Blood Dragon cosmetic armor. 

Now we get to the fancier editions, starting with the de facto [Dragon Age: The Veilguard collector's edition](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-is-dollar150-and-it-doesnt-even-come-with-the-game/). For $150, you can get the lush Rook's Coffer edition, which comes with a Lyrium dagger model, a map of Thedas with a quiver tube, Rook's deck of cards, a potion flask, and a fancy die. Guess what this edition doesn't come with: the game. Like, at all. No digital voucher or anything it seems. And we're not done.

The Vyrantium Pack, which instead of a listed price has a suggestion to "check in with your local retailer to find out about the availability of this edition in your region," comes in a collector's box containing a metal poster, a [Dragon Age](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/dragon-age/) notebook, and a steelbook case for the game. More accurately, that is a steelbook case for the game that *is not included with this edition*. So add $60 or $70 to every edition here, assuming you actually want to play the video game. 

Finally, publisher Dark Horse has assembled a lovely-looking artbook for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and it has three editions of its own, because of course it does. For $49.99, you get the 256-page artbook. The $99.99 deluxe edition bundles in extra prints, an exclusive slipcase, and an alternate cover. Finally, the $55 "while supplies last" BioWare Gear edition, exclusive to [<u>the BioWare Gear website</u>](https://gear.bioware.com/products/the-art-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-hc-bioware-gear-exclusive-variant), comes with "an" exclusive print and its own alternate cover. Phew. 

[<u><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard director says the RPG's big opening</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says-the-rpgs-big-opening-will-make-inquisitions-finale-look-like-a-minor-inconvenience/)* will make Inquisition's finale "look like a minor inconvenience."*
