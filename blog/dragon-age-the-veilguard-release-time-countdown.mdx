The Dragon Age: The Veilguard release time is under 24 hours away – a lovely thing to say out loud as the last game in the RPG series, Inquisition, came out nearly 10 years ago. 

Thankfully, the wait seems to be worth it. [Dragon Age: The Veilguard's Metacritic score](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-metacritic-scores-are-in-and-its-just-short-of-origins-and-inqusition-on-ps5-but-the-series-best-on-pc/) has reviews coming in just below Origins and Inqusition at 84, which isn't bad at all. In fact, our own [Dragon Age: The Veilguard review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/) seems just as taken with it, giving it 4.5 stars.

["Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-4-confirmed-release-date-solas-wishlist-news/) is an approachable, expansive action-oriented RPG and feels like a true end to whatever the franchise was before," we say. "The book's not finished, but a significant chapter has closed.

"While Dragon Age: The Veilguard is undoubtedly different in many ways from its predecessors and takes lessons learned from Mass Effect to heart, there's a lot to love – mechanically and narratively – about the new normal and what is hopefully a foundation for what's to come."

Regardless of what the reviews say, you'll soon get to play [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/)'s next RPG for yourselves. Here's when Dragon Age: The Veilguard releases in your neck of the woods.
