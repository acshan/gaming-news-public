Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake does, in fact, still exist, and during today's [Nintendo Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/nintendo-direct-june-2024-live-coverage-everything-announced/) developer [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) confirmed that the updated JRPG is finally set to launch this year.

Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake officially launches on November 14, 2024. While the news was announced as part of today's Nintendo presentation, a [teaser a few weeks ago](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/after-3-years-of-silence-dragon-quest-3s-gorgeous-remake-rears-its-head-with-a-tease-that-more-hd-2d-jrpg-remakes-are-in-the-works-the-legend-of-erdrick-draws-near/) seemed to confirm the game was also on the way to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Expect official confirmation from Square Enix soon enough, but the release across consoles matches with the publisher's publicly stated intentions to ["aggressively" pursue a multiplatform strategy](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/square-enix-to-shift-from-quantity-to-quality-as-it-aggressively-pursues-a-multiplatform-strategy-which-could-spell-the-end-of-playstation-first-final-fantasy-games/).

As the name suggests, this game is an upgrade of the 8-bit classic Dragon Quest 3 with the gorgeous HD-2D treatment Square Enix has been building since Octopath Traveler. Fans of the publisher's classic JRPGs have been begging for remakes in the HD-2D style for ages, and it looks like those are finally a reality - first with the remake of cult classic Live A Live back in 2022, and now with a more mainstream hit in Dragon Quest 3.

The HD-2D treatment looks gorgeous here - just as it did way back in 2021 when Square Enix first announced the project with a brief teaser trailer. Despite [multiple assurances that the remake was still in the works](https://www.gamesradar.com/jrpg-fans-rejoice-to-learn-dragon-quest-3-hd-is-progressing-quite-steadily-despite-years-of-silence/), it's still a relief to see it resurface with a proper release date here.

It might seem odd to start remaking Dragon Quest with the third entry in the series, but Dragon Quest 3 is actually a prequel set before the original two games. And it just so happens that [Square Enix also announced an HD-2D remake of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 set to launch in 2025](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/square-enix-is-giving-the-original-jrpgs-an-hd-2d-upgrade-with-dragon-quest-1-and-2-in-2025/).
