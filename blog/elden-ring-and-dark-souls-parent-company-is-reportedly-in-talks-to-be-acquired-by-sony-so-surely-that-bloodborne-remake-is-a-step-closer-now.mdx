[Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) is reportedly in talks to acquire Elden Ring and Dark Souls parent company Kadokawa Corporation.

According to a report from [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/), ongoing talks suggest that Sony is attempting to acquire Kadokawa, the Japanese conglomerate that owns [Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/), Dark Souls, and Bloodborne developer [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/). While both companies declined to comment to Reuters, Kadokawa's share price rose 23% after the report broke.

While Sony may have its eyes most firmly fixed on FromSoft, the acquisition would have further reaching goals. For one thing, [Kadokawa is understood to have 26 games in development across its portfolio](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/owner-of-dark-souls-and-elden-ring-developer-fromsoftware-confirms-its-studios-have-20-console-games-in-development-and-we-can-only-hope-one-of-them-is-a-bloodborne-remaster/) (20 console and six mobile). But the company is also a significant producer of anime and manga - its most recent high-profile release in those spheres was Delicious in Dungeon, which released on Netflix in the first half of this year, and is set to return for a second season.

Of course, this isn't the first time that Sony and Kadokawa will have worked closely together. Bloodborne was, and remains, a PS4 exclusive - despite a ream of PS4-era remasters and re-releases, the game is yet to arrive on any new platforms, despite ongoing popularity and several community porting efforts. If Sony were to acquire Kadokawa, and FromSoft with it, I can't imagine that the crowd baying for some kind of return to Yharnam would get any quieter. After all, even Dark Souls director and FromSoft icon [Hidetaka Miyazaki knows "for a fact these guys want a Bloodborne PC port."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/i-know-for-a-fact-these-guys-want-a-bloodborne-pc-port-hidetaka-miyazaki-says-of-fromsoftware-staff-but-if-i-say-i-want-one-ill-get-in-trouble/)
