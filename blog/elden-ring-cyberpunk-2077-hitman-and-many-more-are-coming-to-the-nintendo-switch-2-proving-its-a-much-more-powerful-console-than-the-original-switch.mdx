The [<u>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/) has revealed that [<u>Elden Ring</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/) will be coming to the Switch 2, along with [<u>Hades 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hades-2-guide/), Hitman, and [<u>Street Fighter 6</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/street-fighter-6-guide/).

We knew the Switch 2 would be more powerful, but never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined it would be capable of running a game like Elden Ring or Cyberpunk 2077. It's also getting Hades 2, which was expected, and Street Fighter 6 for the fighting game fans among you. Now I'm excited to see what other [<u>upcoming Switch 2 games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-switch-2-games/) we'll be getting.

The list of third-party last-gen games that will be making their way to the Switch 2 continued to grow throughout today's Direct. Other titles included Hogwarts Legacy and Civilization 7, [which will be joined by 2K brethren Borderlands 4 on the new console, ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-is-launching-on-switch-2-bringing-gearboxs-most-ambitious-borderlands-game-to-nintendos-next-console/)proving that it's not just old games that will be running on the new hardware.

Speaking of new games, one of the bigger surprises was that in addition to Elden Ring, [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) had another game featuring in the Switch 2 reveal - [The Duskbloods is a Switch 2 exclusive coming from the house of Dark Souls. ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-duskbloods-is-coming-exclusively-to-switch-2-in-2026-and-it-looks-it-is-to-bloodborne-as-elden-ring-was-to-dark-souls/)With some seriously gothic architecture and what looks like a pretty expansively open-world approach, there's obviously some Bloodborne DNA there, but also plenty of what helped Elden Ring elevate beyond its older siblings, which is exciting for those of us who've been waiting a decade for a return to Yharnam (in spirit, at least).
