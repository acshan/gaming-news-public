As it would happen, [people getting finessed](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-said-shadow-of-the-erdtree-would-be-hard-and-he-wasnt-kidding-im-getting-stomped/) is a running theme of everyone's time with the DLC thus far. Miyazaki said Shadow of the Erdtree would be hard, but fans are only now finding out how much Miyazaki truly meant that.

Remember the big monster FromSoftware teased for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree? Turns out it's a normal enemy gatekeeping the DLC and not some big ol' boss. Don't worry, though. It's still [kicking everyone's ass.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-big-monster-fromsoftware-teased-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-a-normal-enemy-gatekeeping-the-dlc-and-its-kicking-peoples-butts/)

If the open planes of the Land of Shadow have you feeling lost, you can check out our [Shadow of the Erdtree walkthrough](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/shadow-of-the-erdtree-what-to-do-where-to-go-first/) to find out what to do and when.

Hidetaka Miyazaki has been discussing the importance of difficulty in the games he creates, saying that [Elden Ring wouldn't be the hit it is today if it were easy](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-games-like-elden-ring-have-to-be-hard-if-we-really-wanted-the-whole-world-to-play-the-game-we-could-just-crank-the-difficulty-down/).

"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," Miyazaki explains to [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree). "Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. 

"Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy – which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."

You may think you're ready for Shadow of the Erdtree, but this Dark Souls fan is truly *ready*. 

Streamer itzCBD has apparently become the first ever Elden Ring player to beat the game at level one [through every single New Game Plus difficulty with zero deaths](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/im-ready-for-elden-rings-dlc-but-not-as-ready-as-this-dark-souls-streamer-who-beat-the-whole-action-rpg-at-level-1-multiple-times-from-ng-to-ng7-without-ever-dying/). You are ready, sir.

In more wholesome news, you may have seen that Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree review scores make the DLC the highest-rated expansion of all time, snatching the title away from The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine.  

CD Projekt Red's thoughts? [Former Witcher 3 devs couldn't be happier for FromSoftware.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-overtaken-the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-as-the-highest-rated-dlc-but-the-new-runners-up-dont-mind-if-any-game-had-to-do-it-im-happy-its-elden-ring/) 

"If any game had to do it, I'm happy it's Elden Ring," Blood and Wine quest designer Philipp Weber says. Global community director Marcin Momot adds: "It was a good run. Nevertheless, SUPER HYPED for this Friday."

Good vibes all around.

As those who have stumbled upon the Blackgoal Knight can attest, it looks like Shadow of the Erdtree dials up the difficulty and then some. This always looked like the plan, though. Speaking to [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/), director Hidetaka Miyazaki says the DLC team ["pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/how-hard-is-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hidetaka-miyazaki-says-fromsoftware-has-pushed-the-envelope-in-terms-of-what-we-think-can-be-withstood-by-the-player/#:~:text=As%20for%20the%20bosses%2C%20you,be%20withstood%20by%20the%20player.%22)

You could say Elden Ring is more forgiving than other FromSoftware games due to its open-world nature - stuck? Simply go do something else. Lordy, does it look like we've been made to pay for that? I can't wait to play more.

If you're curious about [Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree's length and size](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-long-to-beat-length/), then publisher Bandai Namco has said what FromSoftware probably should have: [Shadow of the Erdtree "rivals the scope of a standalone game."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-says-what-fromsoftware-probably-should-have-shadow-of-the-erdtree-rivals-the-scope-of-a-standalone-game/)

At a price of 40 bucks, I ain't complaining. I imagine beating the [main Shadow of the Erdtree bosses](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-main-bosses-in-order/) takes up a lot of time, though reviews and early impressions imply you could easily spend just as many hours exploring.

While DLC day is exciting for all, you might want to be careful if you're a fan of playing games horizontally. FromSoftware warns the [latest Elden Ring patch](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-warns-elden-ring-patch-112-might-stunlock-your-steam-deck-going-inactive-for-more-than-5-minutes-may-stop-the-game-from-accepting-inputs/) might stunlock your Steam Deck. Going "inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs."

Don't let that happen to you during a boss fight - I beg.

Here's one thing you'll want to do early in Elden Ring's DLC, if you can manage it. Plenty of hardened veterans are already being humbled by this one early [Shadow of the Erdtree boss](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/returning-elden-ring-veterans-are-being-humbled-by-an-early-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-that-drops-some-of-the-best-armor-in-the-game-if-you-can-beat-the-big-brute/). They're optional, yes, but the prize is worth the struggle - some of the best armor in the game for those heavier builds. 

If you need a hand, our [Shadow of the Erdtree Blackgaol Knight](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-blackgaol-knight/) guide has a few do's and don'ts to bringing the big ol' brute low. 

If you've already gone to the Land of Shadow yourself, you'll want to keep these 5 [Shadow of the Erdtree tips](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips/) in mind. Our guides team has braved those brutal lands and has come away (mostly) unscarred. 

If you're struggling with [Elden Ring's Mohg boss fight](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-mohg-lord-of-blood-how-to-defeat-beat/), now is a good time to request community aid. Plenty gathered around the boss's grounds as it's the entrance to the DLC. While plenty took a second to help out others before going in, [others have hung around](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-veterans-are-celebrating-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-launch-by-helping-others-beat-mohg-so-they-can-join-them-in-the-lands-of-shadow/) to help players get those boss clears so they, too, can join the fun.

Happy Shadow of the Erdtree day to all who celebrate! From those of you who are just getting stuck in to those who have already played well into the night to make some progress. 

As you may recall, Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco announced earlier this month that [many had yet to beat the two bosses necessary](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/as-elden-ring-dlc-nears-publisher-reminds-fans-you-cant-access-shadow-of-the-erdtree-without-beating-2-specific-bosses-as-at-least-77-on-xbox-havent-done-so-yet/) to play the DLC. Now, talking to [GamesIndustry.biz](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch), chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare admits the dire statistics - looking at the 77% of Xbox players who hadn't beat Mohg at some point - ["does present a unique challenge](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/git-gud-and-buy-the-dlc-please-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-says-getting-people-to-beat-mohg-and-radahn-was-key-to-shadow-of-the-erdtree-marketing/)." 

The outlook isn't too grim, thankfully, as Bandai Namco also looks at it as a way of rallying the community - and what better way to market a DLC than that?
