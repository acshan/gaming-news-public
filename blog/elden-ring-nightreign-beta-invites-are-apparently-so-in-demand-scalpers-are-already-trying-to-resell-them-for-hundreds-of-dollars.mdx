[<u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/) will soon begin conducting its short beta test sessions, but if you never managed to even register, there's still hope for you – US scalpers are selling their session invites [<u>for up to $300</u>](https://www.ebay.com/itm/186920228889).

One brave UK seller even lists their eBay "buy it now" price for £400, or nearly $500. Since players will only have limited time to play Nightreign during its network test, that comes out to, oh, just $170 an hour. Though, it's worth noting that $500 is undoubtedly more expensive than the full co-op adventure will be when it releases at some point this year. It might be more worthwhile to put your money into buying [<u>the official Shadow of the Erdtree puzzle</u>](https://store.bandainamcoent.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-puzzle-teaser-key-visual/) fifteen times.

Let's be real: scalping is the bane of gaming and [<u>relatively niche hobbies like it</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tabletop-gaming/the-pokemon-company-addresses-prismatic-evolutions-and-tcg-shortages-as-scalpers-feast-we-are-actively-working-to-print-more/) (there's a Monster High doll I really want, but it's $600 on eBay). It's an annoying, unfair, waste of everyone's day. In 2024, for example, [<u>PS5 Pro scalpers reportedly lost money</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/ps5/ps5-pro-scalpers-may-be-losing-money-on-the-console-but-theyre-still-making-a-profit-on-disc-drives/) on their reselling scheme, since the PS5 Pro was [<u>and is</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-price-bundle-deals/) easy to buy from legit storefronts.


Though, as players scramble for a last-minute chance to experience Nightreign's hardcore co-op before it begins its test on February 14, it's possible more scalpers will get their way. Currently on eBay, there's a small bidding war over a [<u>$60 beta invite</u>](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256799504995?_skw=Elden+Ring+Nightreign). But I think you better save your energy for Elden Ring.
