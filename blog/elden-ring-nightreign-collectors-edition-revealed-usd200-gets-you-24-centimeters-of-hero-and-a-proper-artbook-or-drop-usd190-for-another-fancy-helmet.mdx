Elden Ring Nightreign publisher [Bandai Namco](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bandai-namco/) has unveiled a suite of collector's edition-style swag bags for hardcore [FromSoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) fans to splurge on.

[<u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/) costs $39.99 at base (physical copies only available for PS5 and Xbox Series X), with a $54.99 digital deluxe edition bundling in a digital artbook and soundtrack plus a DLC that is already in development. The DLC will add new areas, bosses, and playable characters when it eventually arrives.

The Elden Ring Nightreign collector's edition proper is a $199.99 package that comes with everything in the digital deluxe edition plus a steelbook case, hardcover artbook, miscellaneous in-game collectibles, and for the crown jewel, a 24-centimeter statue of Wylder, one of the playable [Elden Ring Nightreign characters](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-classes-characters-nightfarers/).

Separately, a $189.99 Elden Ring Nightreign helmet – again, a replica of Wylder – will be available a la carte. You're just paying for the helmet here; the game is not included. This near-life-size bit of merch lines up with the Malenia and Messmer helmets released for Elden Ring and its Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.

As we said in our [Elden Ring Nightreign preview](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-feels-like-a-mod-in-the-best-way-and-after-playing-it-for-over-3-hours-i-think-fromsoftware-can-actually-pull-off-this-roguelike-pivot/), FromSoftware's weirdest game yet is shaping up to be an absurd but fun experiment that feels like a mod in the best way. It's a co-op roguelike where you assemble boss-killing Elden Ring builds on the fly while racing against the timer of a battle royale-style fog wall. It's weird! We've played it for a few hours now, and we'd certainly like to play more.
