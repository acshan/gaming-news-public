The Elden Ring Nightreign network test times are nearly here, so you'll want to get your dates sorted to know precisely when you can try [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/)'s roguelike spin on its beloved open-world RPG.

We've got a complete guide on how to play the [Elden Ring Nightreign beta](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-technical-test/), but the gist is that folks signed up for access in January for the chance to access the upcoming game before launch. While [some have taken to trying to resell their access](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-invites-are-apparently-so-in-demand-scalpers-are-already-trying-to-resell-them-for-hundreds-of-dollars/) since – shocker, I know – others will get to run the rule over Elden Ring Nightreign this week, offering FromSoftware some valuable insight into how servers might hold up and if any glaring balance issues need addressing pronto.

While other betas will let you play for an entire weekend, [Elden Ring Nightreign](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/) is doing things differently. Instead, multiple three-hour slots are happening from February 14 to February 17, so you'll need to pick and choose when you jump in. As for when those slots are, read on for the Elden Ring Nightreign network test times in full.



And there you have it, the Elden Ring Nightreign network test times for those lucky few who got access. We've tried FromSoftware's roguelike take on the Lands Between ourselves, and came away reminded of the modding community. That's a positive, we promise. In our [Elden Ring Nightreign preview](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-feels-like-a-mod-in-the-best-way-and-after-playing-it-for-over-3-hours-i-think-fromsoftware-can-actually-pull-off-this-roguelike-pivot/), we delve into why FromSoftware can actually pull off this roguelike pivot if you fancy some extra reading.
