Elden Ring: Nightreign appears to bring the worlds of Dark Souls and Elden Ring together for the first time, as eagle-eyed fans have spotted iconic Lordan residents in The Lands Between.

[Elden Ring: Nightreign](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/) was announced at [The Game Awards](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/game-awards-2024-everything-announced/) last night - it's a [standalone, three-player adventure played in 40-minute bursts](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/fromsoftwares-next-game-is-elden-ring-nightreign-a-standalone-3-player-adventure-coming-2025-so-was-hidetaka-miyazaki-just-kidding-about-no-elden-ring-2/), but its trailer also revealed something particularly interesting for Dark Souls lore-heads. Iconic characters from the Souls trilogy were spotted in the video - the Firekeeper from Dark Souls 1 and the Nameless King from Dark Souls 3 were both spotted in the video.

The Firekeeper and Nameless King in Elden Ring??? Does this mean Souls games are interconnected now LOL???? pic.twitter.com/LdtG4Xksoy[December 13, 2024](https://twitter.com/tfwPhoebe/status/1867383032296222984)

Clearly, the question is whether this means that the worlds of Dark Souls and Elden Ring are interconnected. Clearly, they're not the *same* worlds, but it's undeniable that these characters are out of place in Nightreign. The answer to that question, however, is a bit complicated. In an interview with [IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service), game director Junya Ishizaki says that "we'd like fans to think of Nightreign as an Elden Ring spin-off," where "the story is completely separate and parallel to the world of Elden Ring's."

If you need a lore reason for that, you'll find it in the shattering. Ishizaki and co "didn't want to encroach" on the story of Elden Ring too much, so Nightreign will "coexist" in a "completely separate branch of the Elden Ring story," which the Shattering is a key part of, essentially splitting the worlds into parallel versions of one another. [Automaton](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/elden-ring-nightrein-director-shares-details-about-high-freedom-co-op-play-day-night-game-cycle-and-dark-souls-cameos/) also suggests that those Dark souls enemies are "representing creatures that have strayed from another universe" - guest stars, rather than the lead antagonists, it seems.

*Given the Sekiro vibes that are also present in Nightreign, this might be a good time to get to grips with the *[<em>best FromSoftware games</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-fromsoftware-games/)*.*
