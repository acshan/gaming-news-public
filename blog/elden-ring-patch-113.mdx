[Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/) patch 1.13 is now live on all platforms after server maintenance earlier today.

Early this morning, [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) announced that Elden Ring's servers would be taken down for maintenance to allow for patch 1.13's launch. This is the second patch since [Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-guide/) launched late last month.

The #ELDENRING servers will undergo maintenance today, July 30, to deploy Patch 1.13.Maintenance will begin at 00:00 PDT | 9:00 CEST | 16:00 JST and will last around 3 hours.Thank you for your patience, Tarnished.[July 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1818165151784206638)

The Elden Ring 1.13 patch notes [themselves](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-113?utm_source=SM_Official&utm_medium=official_post&utm_campaign=EldenRing_PatchNotes_113) are very long, helped by a vast array of bug fixes, but there are a handful of significant early details to pull out. The first of those is a series of PvP balance adjustments, primarily to increase Pose damage on a number of weapons. Sadly, it looks like the [latest PvP exploit reared its head a little late](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/surprise-tarnished-theres-a-new-elden-ring-pvp-exploit-that-lets-you-insta-kill-everyone-in-the-area/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_content=gamesradar&utm_campaign=socialflow), as there's no sign of a fix for it.

Another substantial change is to Spirit Summons, many of which say they "will no longer stagger as easily." That looks like many of the units that you might use to give you a helping hand in a fight are a little more steady on their feet than before. Some of them even have the added benefit of extra HP and attack power, so they'll also hit a little harder.

There's no sign of changes to any bosses, which means that if you're still struggling to best anyone, you're not getting a helping hand from FromSoftware at the moment. In fact, the developers have gone the other way, taking aim at [Shadow of the Erdtree's most broken Sorcery](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/this-sorcery-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-the-most-broken-thing-ive-seen-since-day-one-elden-ring-intel-or-faith-builds-can-use-it-and-i-cant-believe-it-hasnt-been-nerfed/). Players have been using Impenetrable Thorns to gently bash various bosses into submission, but it seems like that'll be a lot harder now - the Thorns now have decreased attack power, poise damage, Hemorrhage buildup and stamina damage.
