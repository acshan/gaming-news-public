The wait for [<u>Elden Ring</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/)'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC has been trying for us all, but one particular Tarnished warrior has seriously been going through it in the run-up to the expansion's launch with a challenge that I could never recommend that you try at home â€“ an Elden Ring drinking game.

The challenge in question was taken on by Twitch streamer and content creator YourBudTevin, who decided to add a new level of difficulty to the Lands Between by taking a drink after every death, as well as after using any summons, and any time that Runes were lost. I cannot emphasize enough how much you *shouldn't *do this given how difficult Elden Ring already is, and of course, it can only get harder the more intoxicated you become.Â 

That might be the reason why [<u>YourBudTevin</u>](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2167190566) struggled so much with the fight against Radagon â€“ the first foe in Elden Ring's brutal two-stage final boss, who the streamer first encounters after over 50 drinks. However, he proves to be quite a tough opponent.Â In a clip shared on Twitter, after 70 deaths from throughout the run, the streamer meets yet another unfortunate demise at the hands of Marika's sweetheart. Something about this death clearly stung a bit more than the others because YourBudTevin broke out into what can only be described as some sort of bird impression before getting, uh, intimate with a green screen and then calmly sitting back down to drink. It'd clearly been a long stream.Â 

I turned Elden Ring into a drinking game where every single time I died, I would take a drink.After 70 deaths, and on the LAST BOSS. This happened.ðŸ’€ pic.twitter.com/Jkonzs5uAO[June 18, 2024](https://twitter.com/YourBudTevin/status/1802931478101147695)

Sadly, even after persisting a while longer, YourBudTevin wasn't able to emerge victorious on this particular stream, capping off the experience after 80 sips. Considering the growing, self-imposed nerf though, it's very understandable.Â 

There's only a few more days to go now until Shadow of the Erdtree is here â€“ Friday, June 21 is the day we've all been waiting for. Hopefully it'll be able to live up to the hype â€“ we'll just have to make sure to [<u>watch out for the new bird enemies</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-most-annoying-type-of-enemy-is-getting-a-new-recruit-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree-and-im-praying-theyre-not-as-bad-as-the-warhawks/), because if they act anything like the Warhawks from the base game, they could be *very *annoying.Â
