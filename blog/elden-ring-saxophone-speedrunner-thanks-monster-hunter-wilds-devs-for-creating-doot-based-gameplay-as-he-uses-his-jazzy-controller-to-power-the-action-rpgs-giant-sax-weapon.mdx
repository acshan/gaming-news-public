> Dr. Doot, famed for his Elden Ring saxophone gameplay, now uses a real saxophone to control a saxophone weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds' beta, showcasing his unique and entertaining gaming style.

One of [<u>Elden Ring</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/)'s greatest heroes, Dr. Doot, is back, but this time he's taking his fabled jazzy controller to pastures new as he dives into [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/), using the in-game saxophone weapon controlled with his own *real *saxophone.

Dr. Doot has provided the internet with some of the most entertaining Elden Ring content around, including a [<u>hitless run of the game using only an electric saxophone</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-magician-uses-nothing-but-a-saxophone-to-beat-all-7-great-rune-bosses-including-malenia-without-taking-a-hit/) and a boss speedrun that even saw [<u>Malenia fall to the power of jazz in less than a minute</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/watch-in-awe-as-an-elden-ring-master-playing-with-a-saxophone-that-goes-doot-finally-wrecks-malenia-in-45-seconds-without-getting-hit/). As for how it works, a pitch bend knob on the back of the instrument doubles as his left analog stick, while the notes he plays are mapped to a regular controller's buttons, meaning he has to doot and toot in a variety of ways to pull off even the most basic inputs.

Enter Monster Hunter Wilds, and [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) has been cooking up a weapon that practically has Dr. Doot's name written all over it. Specifically, you can get your hands on a Hunting Horn weapon in the action RPG's open beta – the Hope Horn, to be exact – that's literally just a massive saxophone. The streamer first found out about its existence way back in August last year, when [<u>he responded</u>](https://x.com/DrDootPhD/status/1826416172105171136): "OH MY GOD THERE'S AN ACTUAL SAXOPHONE WEAPON IN MONSTER HUNTER WILDS?"

Now though, his time has come. Last week, he [<u>expressed his excitement</u>](https://x.com/DrDootPhD/status/1887716224152289390) over the fact that "MONSTER HUNTER WILDS LETS ME HUNT MONSTERS WITH A GIANT SAXOPHONE," and thanked the devs for "CREATING DOOT-BASED GAMEPLAY," and now he's finally shared what we've all been waiting for – his controller in action.

"Everyone asked 'Will you use the giant saxophone weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds with [the] saxophone controller?'" he writes on Twitter. "The answer is yes (obviously) but no one told me it would be this much FUN." Attached is a short but sweet clip of his skills in action – taking out the beta's frog-like Chatacabra monster with a series of well-timed doots. I can't even begin to fathom how much practice goes into these sorts of challenges.

Hopefully, this won't be the last of the streamer's antics in Monster Hunter Wilds if his tweet is anything to go by. The action RPG's next beta session kicks off on February 14, and will [<u>run for an extra 24 hours to make up for last weekend's PlayStation Network outage</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/as-psn-outages-subside-capcom-might-extend-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-for-an-extra-day-as-the-test-period-was-cut-short/). After that, we don't have too long to wait for its full launch on February 28.
