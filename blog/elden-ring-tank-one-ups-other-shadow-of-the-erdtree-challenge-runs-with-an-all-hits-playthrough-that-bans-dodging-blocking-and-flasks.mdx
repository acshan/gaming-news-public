[Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/) challenges are getting a little hard to top. After players beat the game's nail-biting bosses with their [pet goldfish](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-rings-infamous-boss-godrick-will-never-recover-from-losing-to-a-goldfish-rigged-up-to-a-webcam/), a [Wiimote Greatsword](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/playing-elden-ring-becomes-a-sweaty-workout-with-this-7ft-greatsword-peripheral-that-acts-like-a-very-complicated-wiimote/), or by [turning them all into Malenia](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-player-turns-every-enemy-into-malenia-still-beats-the-game/) - what can you possibly do to one-up them? One player is trying anyway with an "ALL HIT" run, and they've just beaten the boss that's been absolutely wiping the floor with [Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-guide/) entrants. 

"You've all seen 'No Hit' runs of the DLC's final boss," YouTuber Recjawjind [explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dpzkg6/youve_all_seen_no_hit_runs_of_the_dlcs_final_boss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), referring to the challenge runs where people play through the game without taking a single hit. "Now get ready for the opposite." The video below shows the content creator making light work of the game's final boss without dodging, blocking attacks, or healing with a flask. It's quite literally all hits. Be wary of spoilers below for that boss if you've not already seen or fought it, though.

The [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) video's description mentions that their rune level is at 200 and their Scadutree Blessing level is at +20, meaning you probably shouldn't try this at home. The character is pretty much a certified tank, just look at the way they shrug off meteor strikes like it's nothing. (If you *do *wanna take on an All Hits challenge for yourself, be sure to check out our guide to [all Scadutree Fragment locations in Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/).)

Be sure to stick around for the end to see our Tarnished literally chuck a pot at the dying god's defeated body to really twist the knife in. What a sassy send off. 

Over on Reddit, Recjawjind explains that they're using a Crimson Bubbletear Physick Flask to automatically restore health right before the meteors burn through their health pool. A blessing boon also topped up the player's health by regenerating 8 HP per second, which explains how they managed to get so effortlessly tanky.
