As revealed by [<u>Bethesda Game Studios</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bethesda-game-studios/) today, [<u>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-guide/) is real after all – and nearly two decades after the original RPG released, the remake is now also finally available to play.

Following [<u>Oblivion remaster leaks</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/as-the-official-oblivion-remaster-is-all-but-confirmed-the-modder-whos-been-unofficially-remaking-the-rpg-in-skyrim-for-13-years-says-this-changes-nothing-for-me/) and rumors of an [<u>apparent release date</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastered-hasnt-been-officially-announced-but-xbox-support-seemingly-has-no-qualms-about-sharing-the-unconfirmed-rpgs-apparent-release-date-if-you-ask-nicely/) that turned out to be false, Bethesda has lifted the veil on its stunning remaster from Virtuos Games during an [<u>announcement stream</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/after-days-of-oblivion-remaster-leaks-bethesda-suggests-it-will-finally-be-announced-and-possibly-released-tomorrow-all-will-be-revealed/) today – and while the game didn't launch yesterday as prophesied by the web, it's out in the wild and ready to play now. One thing fans were correct about, however, is how impressive both visually and gameplay-wise the remake of the 2006 banger truly looks to be.

As previously highlighted in handy [<u>side-by-side comparisons</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-looks-more-real-than-ever-as-screenshots-from-virtuos-leak-and-reports-point-to-a-shadow-drop-next-week/) of the OG title and its remaster, the new Oblivion almost feels like an entirely different game with its lush vegetation, moody lighting, and revamped enemies, making for the perfect semi-realistic fantasy environments. It's almost reminiscent of a modded [<u>Skyrim</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/skyrim-guide/) experience, albeit a more fluid one (you know, without all the load order shenanigans and random crashing), set in Cyrodiil.

The use of Unreal Engine 5 certainly helps, with Virtuos developers detailing during the big stream how it helped them give the remastered game a more immersive feel. As for the RPG's gameplay, Oblivion Remastered seems to harbor the same quirky dialogue that longtime players know and love the fourth Elder Scrolls entry for while also featuring an intense, overhauled combat system to make for an experience that's both familiar and fresh. If you're just as excited to hop back into the Imperial capital of Tamriel as I am, you can grab Oblivion Remastered for $49.99 or its Deluxe Edition for $59.99 (yes, with add-ons, expansions, [<u>infamous horse armor DLC</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/as-oblivion-remaster-rumors-persist-witcher-4-narrative-director-calls-the-og-rpgs-infamous-horse-armor-dlc-which-kicked-off-the-microtransaction-era-an-integral-part-of-gaming-history/) included, and all) on [<u>PC and Xbox Series S|X</u>](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/9NQR437K7PQH/0010) or [<u>PlayStation 5</u>](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA21203_00-ALTAR00000000000/). The remaster is also available for free to those with an active Game Pass subscription on both PC and Xbox, or alternatively, on [<u>Steam</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/) – and it's playable on the Steam Deck, too. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a childhood to go and relive.*Here's everything you need to know about *[<u><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-location-news-races/)* after replaying Oblivion.*
