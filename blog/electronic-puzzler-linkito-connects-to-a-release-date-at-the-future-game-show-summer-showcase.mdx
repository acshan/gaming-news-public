Linkito is a puzzle game set in a '50s era dystopia, where you work as an engineer in Albatown, the "last known bastion of civilization and progress" controlled by the shady Albatross Technologies. A cinematic trailer shown during the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Summer Showcase has exclusively revealed its release date, so you'll be able to connect to the system on July 23.

The story trailer didn't show any gameplay, so let me explain a little of how it works. Each level is a puzzle presented in the form of a circuit, and you must use your electrical knowledge to rewire, power, and activate more than 100 different types of blocs to learn how they work and use them to solve logical conundrums. However, this is more than simply keeping the lights on, as you'll also be repairing machines, controlling robots, and even defusing bombs!

What's more, as you delve deeper into the system you'll begin to discover hidden messages that can be deciphered using the skills you've learned, to start piecing together the truth about what Albatross Technologies is really up to and help you lead the fight back against the corporate machine. Work your way up to the top, and you might just be able to counteract their sinister plans.

Once you've mastered the logic of Linkito's systems, you can also use the built in level editor to make electric puzzles of your own. Challenge other players to solve your creations, and try to beat the best the community has to offer.

Linkito is coming to PC via Steam on July 23, but if you can't wait that long there's a [demo available on Steam now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2312770/Linkito/) to start practicing your circuit-wiring skills.
