EVE Galaxy Conquest, the mobile strategy spin-off to the sci-fi MMO phenomenon EVE Online, just unveiled a new cinematic trailer exclusively at the Mobile Gaming Show.

Introduced by CCP Games' CEO Hilmar Veigar Petursson, EVE Galaxy Conquest will put you in control of iconic ships from Eve Online, eventually controlling an entire armada in your attempt to take back New Eden and craft your own legacy.

The trailer puts the famous battles of Eve Online front and center – but it also puts you on the back foot. When lawless factions banded together under a single banner, the forces of the Empire – weakened by years of infighting – were all but destroyed, retreating to the edge of known space in order to rebuild, amassing their fleets and taking any helping hand they can find.



Welcome to [Mobile Gaming Week 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/mobile-gaming/gamesradar-presents-mobile-gaming-week-2024/), where we explore what's hot, what's best, and what's next in the world of mobile gaming following the Mobile Gaming Showcase.

That's where you come in. This new generation of war needs a new type of leader, and Eve: Galaxy Conquest puts those forces in the palm of your hand. You'll fight alongside allies in 4X strategy gameplay; gathering resources, establishing your territory, exploring space, and taking on your enemies. Eventually, with famous ships from Eve history at your disposal, you'll take back the galaxy. You might even find some famous faces too – as long as you're prepared to indulge in some slightly unseemly technology.

*Eve: Galaxy Conquest is due to release on October 29, 2024 on both Android and iOS devices, and you can pre-order right now on both the App Store and the Google Play store, or pre-register now at *[<em>EveGalaxyConquest.com</em>](http://www.EveGalaxyConquest.com)*.*
