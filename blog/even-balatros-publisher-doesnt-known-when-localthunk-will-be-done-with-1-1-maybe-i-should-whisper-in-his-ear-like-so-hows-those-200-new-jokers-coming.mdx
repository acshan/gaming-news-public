Balatro 1.1 is on the way, and at the Game Developers Conference this week Wout van Halderen of publisher Playstack [reconfirmed that it's still on track for 2025](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatros-first-big-update-is-still-on-track-for-2025-but-itll-be-done-when-its-done-because-its-got-to-be-good-before-its-fast/). But even the game's own publisher is in the dark about exactly when the update is coming or what'll be in it.

Our friends at [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/hes-just-gonna-show-up-one-day-and-say-heres-100-new-jokers-balatros-publisher-doesnt-know-how-big-the-1-1-update-will-be-or-when-its-coming/) did their best to extract what info about Balatro 1.1 they could from van Halderen, but to no avail – in part because LocalThunk himself hasn't even provided that info. I don't think he'll let us know when [Balatro 1.1] is gonna drop. He's just gonna show up one day and say, here's 100 new jokers."

That's not a confirmation of how many jokers are gonna be added in 1.1, but van Halderen has his own thoughts on how to get the info from LocalThunk. "Maybe I should whisper in his ear, like, 'So how's those 200 new jokers coming?' And then see where that goes. But I am gonna be surprised, probably just as much [as you]. I may hear it a couple days before everyone else."

LocalThunk is a game developer who values privacy, and has notably chosen not to appear in public – even to accept his wildly popular game's trophies at The Game Awards. But he has been happy to use his game's success to [lift up other indie devs, noting that "I just happen to be the lucky one to be propped up."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-reacts-to-the-game-awards-noms-by-telling-you-to-play-other-indie-games-that-werent-nominated-i-just-happen-to-be-the-lucky-one-to-be-propped-up/)
