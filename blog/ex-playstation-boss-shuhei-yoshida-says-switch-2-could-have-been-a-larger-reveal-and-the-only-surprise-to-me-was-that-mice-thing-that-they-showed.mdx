Former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has suggested he wasn't overly impressed with the [Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) reveal and hopes Nintendo has a few more tricks up its sleeve.

In an interview with MinnMax ([timestamped here](https://youtu.be/HtiJlzs0xRE?si=Gr20RvwUDExLsiAJ&t=1258)), Yoshida shared his reaction to [Nintendo's long-awaited announcement of the Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-is-coming-this-year-with-a-full-nintendo-switch-2-direct-next-month/), which happened a couple of weeks ago after many months of rumors and leaks. Nintendo fully revealed the new console, as well as what looks like a [brand-new Mario Kart game](https://www.gamesradar.com/mario-kart-9-guide/), but didn't anything that makes it particularly unique from the original Switch.

"I thought the Switch 2 announcement could have been a larger reveal," Yoshida said. "It turned out to be kind of a reveal or just confirmation of, yeah, you know this is Switch 2 and this is Switch 2. I was surprised there were not many surprises. The only surprise to me was that mice thing that they showed."

With a [Switch 2-focused Direct coming on April 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-direct-switch-2-april-2025-guide/), Nintendo definitely still has time to hit us with that classic Nintendo charm. I'm personally really hoping the new console is more than just a bigger, more powerful Switch, and it sounds like Yoshida feels the same.

"Hopefully, because it's Nintendo, they'll use it in some weird, amazing way, something that people wouldn't anticipate. I hope in the next show in the beginning of April they'll reveal something that is still hidden to us about Switch 2."

Yoshida retired from [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) in January after 31 years with the company, and he's been pretty outspoken on a variety of topics since then. Right after his retirement, [he voiced his surprise at Horizon Forbidden West's sales underperformance compared to Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-says-hes-surprised-by-horizon-forbidden-wests-success-compared-to-zero-dawns-own-i-was-hoping-that-the-sequel-would-do-even-better/), and more recently [he shared his take on the failure of the PS Vita](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/handhelds/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-says-the-vita-failed-because-a-lot-of-technical-choices-werent-good-ones-and-sony-couldnt-support-ps4-at-the-same-time/). Just a few days ago, [he said a normal publisher would've canceled The Last Guardian](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/playstation-icon-shuhei-yoshida-says-a-normal-publisher-wouldve-canceled-the-last-guardian-but-even-when-it-was-running-at-10-15-fps-on-ps3-he-insisted-we-have-to-release-it/).
