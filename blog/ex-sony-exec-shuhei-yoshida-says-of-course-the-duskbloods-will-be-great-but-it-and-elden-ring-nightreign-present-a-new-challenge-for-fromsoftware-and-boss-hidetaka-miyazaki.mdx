Dark Souls developer [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) may be currently working on not one, but two multiplayer games at the moment – [<u>The Duskbloods</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-duskbloods-guide/) and [<u>Elden Ring Nightreign</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/) – but former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida thinks the studio might have trouble adapting to them. FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki just isn't a PvP fan, [as he's said himself](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-shares-the-duskbloods-worries-of-some-elden-ring-and-dark-souls-fans-i-personally-am-not-much-of-a-pvp-person-and-i-wanted-to-make-something-thats-satisfying-even-for-players-like-me/).

"I think it's a new challenge for [FromSoftware], to design game for multiplayer," Yoshida [<u>tells Easy Allies</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTzHlC_vrE) in a recent podcast episode. "Miyazaki-san [isn't] necessarily a big fan of PvP games, so [FromSoftware] will try to make it more accommodating for the people who are kind of intimidated to play the PvP game."

In a [Creator's Voice conversation](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-says-we-still-intend-to-develop-single-player-focused-games-even-as-the-duskbloods-follows-elden-ring-nightreign-into-multiplayer/) transcript, Miyazaki again suggests a similar idea, clarifying that FromSoftware has not "decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction" after The Duskbloods and Nightreign are released.

"We still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as [Elden Ring] that embrace our more traditional style," he says.

For his part, Yoshida admits that "I'm not a good FPS player, either, so I don't play these competitive games." Regardless, he says vampiric PvPvE The Duskbloods is his most anticipated Switch 2 title, and "of course" it "should be great" in the end.

"That game, coming from FromSoftware with the design sensibility to accommodate people like me – I'm very excited," Yoshida tells Easy Allies.

Elden Ring Nightreign will release on May 30 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, and PC, while The Duskbloods will be out sometime in 2026 as a Switch 2 exclusive.
