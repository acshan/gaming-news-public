Co-op archaeological adventure Run From Mummies announced a Fall 2024 release date in a new trailer debut at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/). When it arrives you'll be able to explore tombs with up to three friends, exploring seven different regions as you avoid traps, battle enemies and, you know, move fast away from anyone a bit... pharaoh-y. And, if that has your interest, then check out a free demo you can play right now.

Key to surviving in this up to 4-player couch co-op tomb raid is your camera and its *unnecessarily *bright flash. Using its light blasts you can interact with the world in a range of different ways - anything from triggering traps to killing dangerous scarabs and stunning pursuing mummies to make a quick getaway. Crucially you can also use your camera to take pictures of ancient artifacts, the real reason you're dodging monsters and boulders in a range of varied tombs. 

There are 100 levels, over seven different regions to explore, including temples, deserts, and tombs to take on solo, or with up to three friends. As you encounter a range of varied enemies, traps, and a range of mummies you and your tour group will be able to call on a range of abilities - as each tourist has their own abilities and quirks to use as you investigate. 

As you explore and get further in, you'll uncover puzzles, boss fights, and a story inspired by Egyptian mythology.
