In the Bethesda-era of the [Fallout](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout/) series, no game has had a bigger map than the MMO spinoff [Fallout 76](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76/). While most didn't really like the game at launch (our [GamesRadar+ review](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-review/) gave it a 2.5 back in 2018), it's grown in popularity over the years and now sits at [a 'Mostly Positive'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/) rating on [Steam](https://www.gamesradar.com/steam/). And one of the reasons players are more fond of it now is partly due to just how damn big it is, with it only [getting bigger with every new expansion](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-76-skyline-valley-update-preview-june-2024/). But even at launch the game was touted as being[ "four times the size of Fallout 4,"](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-revealed-is-four-times-the-size-of-fallout-4-and-available-to-pre-order-very-soon/) but it turns out that almost wasn't the case.

At a 2025 Game Developers Conference (GDC) panel attended by GamesRadar+, Fallout 76 lead artist Nate Purkeypile revealed that they had to fight to make the map just as big as it was. "Fallout 76's map was huge; it's actually even bigger than Skyrim, and that was something I had to fight for really hard from the start," Purkeypile said, explaining, "I knew it was a game people were going to be spending a lot of time in, and I wanted to capture that epic feel of the West Virginia wilderness." Making a bigger map for a game designed to be played near-endlessly seems to be a given, but it's interesting to hear that Bethesda was originally in favor of a smaller version.

Purkeypile also talked about how he felt about the game's reception at launch, saying, "even though the game had a rocky launch, people liked the map. It was kind of nice to hear 'hey, that game sucks, but the map's pretty cool'. I did my job."

[<em>Speaking of open-world survival games, the Minecraft developers recently said that the game won't be going free-to-play, saying, "It doesn't really work with the way we built it." </em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/minecraft/dont-expect-minecraft-to-go-free-to-play-anytime-soon-as-mojang-says-it-doesnt-really-work-with-the-way-we-built-it/)
