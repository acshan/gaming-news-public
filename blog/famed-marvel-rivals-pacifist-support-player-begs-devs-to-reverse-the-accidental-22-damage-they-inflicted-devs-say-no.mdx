Tragedy struck [Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/) earlier this week when 'NoDamageRocket' - a support player who mains Rocket Raccoon without dealing a lick of damage - [accidentally dished out 22 points worth of pain unto the enemy team](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/tragedy-in-marvel-rivals-as-the-calmest-healer-almost-hits-celestial-rank-without-dealing-damage-but-accidentally-loses-their-pacifist-cred-i-guess-im-22dmgrocketnow/). And now, the bad news only continues as the Marvel Rivals support team has flat-out refused the player's request to delete their accidental slip-up.

[NoDamageRocket achieved the mind-blowing feat of reaching Grandmaster rank in solo queue all while being a](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-player-hits-grandmaster-rank-without-dealing-a-single-point-of-damage-all-while-role-playing-rocket-raccoon-it-honestly-just-kinda-happened/)[Â ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-player-hits-grandmaster-rank-without-dealing-a-single-point-of-damage-all-while-role-playing-rocket-raccoon-it-honestly-just-kinda-happened/)pacifist in the chaotic hero shooter. That means they were focused on healing and support the entire time. No bullets were fired. No damage dealt. No kills. No self-defense, even. Until their recent blemish, that is.

In an attempt to simply delete the accidental 22-damage inflicted on a Clock & Dagger, NoDamageRocket actually emailed developer NetEase. "I accidentally did an oopsie while playing competitive and hurt someone," their email, posted to [social media](https://x.com/NoDamageRocket/status/1883971339729658191), reads. "Not to worry though, Rocket apologized to them and has taken actions to improve himself! Could you please take that silly little 22 damage number off of Rocket's stat?"

In a follow-up [tweet](https://x.com/NoDamageRocket/status/1884374570125385751), the player who's since reached Celestial rank wrote that "Rocket got an answer back, it's a no," which is fine because "that's to be expected, Rocket did it as a joke anyways" and "will carry on the 22 dmg as a reminder for dashing too close to the sun!" A good way to take it on the chin and preserve their pacifist street cred anyway.

Elsewhere in the game, the [Marvel Rivals team threatened keyboard and mouse adapter users with permanent bans](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-devs-threaten-keyboard-and-mouse-adapter-users-with-permanent-bans-on-pc-or-console-we-will-take-measures-to-vanquish-this-nefarious-behavior/): "On PC or console, we will take measures to vanquish this nefarious behavior."
