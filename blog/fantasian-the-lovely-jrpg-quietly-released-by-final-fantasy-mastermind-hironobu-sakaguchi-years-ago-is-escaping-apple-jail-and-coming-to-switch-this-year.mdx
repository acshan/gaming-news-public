[As rumors have long suggested](https://www.gamesradar.com/looks-like-the-acclaimed-jrpg-from-final-fantasys-creators-is-finally-coming-to-a-platform-where-you-can-actually-buy-it/), Fantasian, the lovely JRPG from Final Fantasy mastermind Hironobu Sakaguchi, also featuring composer Nobuo Uematsu, is breaking out of Apple Arcade and onto Nintendo Switch later this year. 

Announced during today's [Nintendo Direct live](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/nintendo-direct-june-2024-live-coverage-everything-announced/) showcase, Fantasian: Neo Dimension brings the 2021 Apple Arcade hit to Switch sometime this holiday season, specifically winter. Naturally, that's all that was confirmed during the Nintendo stream. There were [previously traces of a Steam release as well](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-creators-latest-jrpg-could-be-released-from-apple-arcade-jail-and-i-couldnt-be-more-excited/), though we're still awaiting confirmation there.  (Update: [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) has confirmed that Fantasian: Neo Dimension is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC this winter.)  

For now, it's nice to see Fantasian escape mobile platforms and find a new audience. As the latest game from Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey developer Mistwalker, the 2021 RPG was well received, earning a solid 80 on [<u>Metacritic</u>](https://www.metacritic.com/game/fantasian/).  

"Assume the role of Leo as he journeys to recover his memories and solve the mystery of a strange mechanical infection destroying his world," the official blurb reads. "Experience an original and modern take on the beloved turn-based battle system, with a wealth of unique mechanics and strategic combat that shake up the classic RPG formula, and explore a multi-dimensional universe come to life set against the backdrop of over 150 charming hand-crafted dioramas."

Presumably, in addition to TV-appropriate upscaled art, the console version boasts "brand new features including English and Japanese voiceovers and an additional difficulty option." 

It's been a great [Nintendo Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/nintendo-direct/) for re-released RPGs. [<u>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake finally launches over 3 years after it was first revealed, and it's not just on Switch</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-finally-launches-over-3-years-after-it-was-first-revealed-and-its-not-just-on-switch/). Better still, [<u>Square Enix is giving the original JRPGs an HD-2D upgrade with Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 in 2025</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-quest/square-enix-is-giving-the-original-jrpgs-an-hd-2d-upgrade-with-dragon-quest-1-and-2-in-2025/), completing the Erdrick trilogy.
