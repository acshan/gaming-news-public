Final Fantasy 7 part 3 won't be a PS6 exclusive, breaking the trend set by [Remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-guide/) and [<u>Rebirth</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guide/), which were only on PS4 and PS5 respectively before coming to PC.

In a recent interview with [<u>4Gamer</u>](https://www.4gamer.net/games/865/G086563/20250121053/) (with translations provided by [<u>VGC</u>](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-wont-be-a-ps6-exclusive-producer-promises/)), producer Yoshinori Kitase says we can "rest assured" that the third game in the Remake trilogy won't be exclusive to PS6. Remake was exclusive to the PS4 before it came to PC, and Rebirth never touched the PS4 at all but launches on PC today.

If you're wondering why we're reporting on the PS6 when it hasn't even been announced yet, it's because Final Fantasy 7 Part 3 hasn't been in development for long. [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) started work on it "right after Rebirth ended, in March, April 2024, so weâ€™ve been developing it for about nine months already," Kitase says, and [<u>the plot has been completed</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/the-plot-for-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-is-complete-and-the-team-is-now-moving-forward-with-the-jrpgs-development/) already. Remake came out in April 2024, so we may be waiting until 2028 to play the final entry of this series.

By then, the PS6 will likely be out, and after [<u>the supply issues</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/playstation-boss-says-ps5-supply-issues-are-resolved/) we all faced when the PS5 first launched, it makes sense people are worried about anything being exclusive to the platform when it comes out.

This doesn't mean that the game won't be exclusive to PlayStation, however. It may simply be available on both the PS5 and PS6. Don't hold your breath for a PS4 version, though. Square Enix said last year that [<u>Rebirth sales were "below expectations,"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/square-enix-admits-it-might-be-cannibalizing-its-own-games-as-multiple-rpgs-including-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-get-hit-with-its-classic-below-expectations-line/) so it may try to break from [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) exclusivity for the finale and come to Xbox, too, or launch on PC at the same time rather than months later.
