Hironobu Sakaguchi is working with [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) again after 20 years to [spring Fantasian from Apple Arcade jail and onto PCs and consoles.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/fantasian-the-lovely-jrpg-quietly-released-by-final-fantasy-mastermind-hironobu-sakaguchi-years-ago-is-escaping-apple-jail-and-coming-to-switch-this-year/) As it would happen, there are other games from his post-Square Enix back catalogue he wants to do the same with – just probably not the ones you're thinking of. 

Speaking to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-03/-final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-reunites-with-square-enix?srnd=technology-vp), Sakaguchi confirms he has no interest in bringing Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon to modern platforms despite [hopes of the opposite.](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-boss-says-fans-can-count-on-more-japanese-exclusives-like-blue-dragon-and-lost-odyssey/)

Boo! In better news, he apparently wants to find a way to revive another game he did called Terra Battle, which was released for mobiles back in 2014, but it is no longer playable. A tile-based tactical RPG with collectible card and puzzle game elements, it launched to a decent reception and even got a sequel in 2017, though it was shortlived and pulled from digital shelves a year later.

For now, the focus remains on Fantasian. A new version, Fantasian Neo Dimension, will be released on PCs and consoles this winter. It features various upgrades, such as 4K graphics, voice acting, and a new difficulty mode. 

Sakaguchi says the Square Enix collaboration came from a dinner with Final Fantasy 14 director and producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida, who suggested Square Enix take on the project when Sakaguchi mentioned wanting to broaden the throwback JRPG's horizons. 

“I was a little bit concerned about how people would feel about working with me — perhaps they’ll have mixed feelings,” Sakaguchi says of the Square Enix reunion. “It was actually quite a warm welcome. Once the news was announced, I got tweets from a lot of current Square staff saying, ‘Welcome back, Sakaguchi-san.’ Some people I know, some I don’t. Everyone’s working hard toward a common goal.”
