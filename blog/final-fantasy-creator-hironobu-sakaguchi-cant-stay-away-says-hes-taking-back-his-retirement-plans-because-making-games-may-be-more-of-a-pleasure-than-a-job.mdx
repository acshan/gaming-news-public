Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi says he reversed course on his retirement plans because he simply loves making games that much.

In a machine-translated [Famitsu](https://www.famitsu.com/article/202409/16065) interview, Sakaguchi confirmed he's still working with the same team behind the 2021 mobile RPG Fantasian, [which is finally getting a console and PC release this winter](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/fantasian-the-lovely-jrpg-quietly-released-by-final-fantasy-mastermind-hironobu-sakaguchi-years-ago-is-escaping-apple-jail-and-coming-to-switch-this-year/), on a brand new project, although he had no new updates to provide.

"I made Fantasian thinking it might really be a retirement piece, but yes, I am withdrawing it," Sakaguchi said. "We are starting to make progress on a new work ... which means we are working on a new one."

This isn't a new announcement, by the way. We first learned back in December 2022 that Sakaguchi was working on a "dark fantasy" game after [he made comments suggesting Fantasian could be his final project](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-creator-sakaguchi-says-he-could-retire-after-his-next-game/). In November 2023, [he again affirmed he was working on a new "dark fantasy" game](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-father-hironobu-sakaguchi-has-a-new-project-in-the-works/), and at the top of this year [he revealed he'd finished a plot outline despite being kept thoroughly busy playing Final Fantasy 14](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-founder-is-writing-a-new-game-but-hes-still-playing-too-much-final-fantasy-14/).

Now, for the first time, he's given one definitive reason he decided against leaving game development, and it's really simple: "One thing I can say is that game production is fun. It may be more of a pleasure than a job."

He continued: "It may be that I am getting older, but I really feel that friends are really nice. I am excited to be able to develop games with everyone again. On a personal note, I am expecting a grandchild soon. I hope to incorporate what I feel at that time into the new game."

The idea of Sakaguchi drawing from his experience as a new grandparent is exciting â€“ much, if not all, of his best work was directly shaped by powerful experiences and emotions. Welcoming a new family member would certainly fit that bill. One way or the other, I'd imagine many JRPG fans are happy to hear we haven't seen the last of Sakaguchi. [He only recently reconnected with Square Enix after decades away](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/final-fantasy-creator-says-returning-to-square-enix-after-20-years-was-like-returning-to-your-home-in-the-countryside-this-old-home-that-your-parents-always-had/), which he described as "like returning to your home in the countryside, this old home that your parents always had."
