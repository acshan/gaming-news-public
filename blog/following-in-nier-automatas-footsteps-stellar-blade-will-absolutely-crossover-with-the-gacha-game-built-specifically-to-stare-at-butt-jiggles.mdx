Stellar Blade is rolling out across the world today, but launch certainly isn't the end since its director has teased a crossover between the hack-n-slashin' action game and the studio's previous gacha release, best known for its - *checks notes - *butt-jiggling physics. 

Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung-tae, when asked about potential collaborations during an interview with [GamerBraves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIwFsT24PCs), said we can "absolutely" expect a crossover with the free-to-play gacha game Goddess of Victory: Nikke, which was also developed by studio Shift Up. 

"At the right timing, we will be presenting a very high-quality crossover collaboration between the two," Hyung-tae continues, "so it's something that you can definitely look forward to." There's no word on whether the crossover event will take place in Stellar Blade, Nikke, or both - but a crossover is coming all the same. 

Goddess of Victory: Nikke, for those of you who are blissfully unaware, makes itself extra marketable with a peculiar focus on the character's backsides and, err, the way everything wobbles mid-animation. [Nier Automata's 2B even joined the game](https://www.gamesradar.com/oh-dear-god-nier-automatas-next-collab-is-the-gacha-game-explicitly-built-for-staring-at-jiggling-butts/) to make its selling point even clearer, and since [the Stellar Blade team also paid "special attention" to protagonist Eve's posterior](https://www.gamesradar.com/stellar-blade-dev-also-known-for-butt-jiggling-game-nikke-says-he-put-special-attention-into-the-female-leads-back-because-thats-what-players-see-most-of-the-time/), I wouldn't be surprised to see her join the battle either.  

Our [Stellar Blade review](https://www.gamesradar.com/stellar-blade-review/) called the action RPG "more ambitious and varied than expected" with bombastic boss battles and production values that only a butt-jiggling, gacha-driven game studio could afford. But [the game's "forced sex appeal" also hurts its story](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/stellar-blade-puts-eve-in-some-incredibly-stupid-sexy-outfits-but-i-love-her-design-and-had-fun-with-this-action-rpg-anyway/), even if it provides Stellar Blade with its most marketable asset.
