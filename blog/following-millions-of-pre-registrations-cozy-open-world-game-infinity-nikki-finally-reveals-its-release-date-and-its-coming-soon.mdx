Infinity Nikki, a mind-bogglingly beautiful open-world dress-up game headed by none other than [<u>former Breath of the Wild dev</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ive-not-stopped-thinking-about-this-open-world-dress-up-game-from-a-former-breath-of-the-wild-dev-for-2-years-and-now-it-finally-has-a-playtest/) Kentaro Tominaga, finally has a release date - and it's not too far off.

Following the debut of its [<u>new trailer</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/cozy-open-world-dress-up-adventure-game-headed-by-breath-of-the-wild-dev-gets-a-new-trailer-and-an-incredible-soundtrack-brain-worm/) at [<u>Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/), Infinity Nikki stole the hearts of countless cozy gamers globally and managed to rack up [<u>over 12 million pre-registrations</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/cozy-open-world-game-headed-by-breath-of-the-wild-dev-already-has-over-12-million-pre-registered-players-and-youd-better-believe-im-one-of-them/) in just a few days. With the upcoming game standing as the follow-up to a successful series of mobile dress-up titles spanning over 12 years, this figure isn't all that surprising - and it's only continued to grow since then.

There wasn't any news regarding a potential launch window or release date until now, though, and it seems there's thankfully not long left to wait. As revealed by developer Infold Games in a recent [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1856882674948026482), Infinity Nikki is launching on December 5 this year. In celebration of their announcement, devs have also teamed up with musician Jessie J to create the game's latest trailer and are hosting a giveaway for followers.

It's certainly an exciting time to be a Love Nikki stan, and I personally can't wait to dive back into the new game after my time with it during my [<u>preview</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/infinity-nikki-is-a-stunning-open-world-game-that-somehow-fits-in-almost-everything-ive-ever-wanted-and-i-already-cant-wait-to-play-more/) last month.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have virtual outfits to plan for December 5.
