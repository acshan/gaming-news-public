For a brief window, the Borderlands movie wasn't the worst-reviewed film to release this month, but it's now reclaimed that un-enviable title.Â 

Earlier this month, [<u>Borderlands debuted to a 0% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/action-movies/borderlands-movie-rotten-tomatoes-0-per-cent-score/), with none of the 23 reviewers who offered their early impressions returning a positive verdict. Since then, that figure has increased to 10% - which, for a brief time, was enough to ensure that Borderlands wasn't the worst-reviewed movie of the month.

When The Crow, a reboot of 1995's gothic superhero franchise, first appeared on Rotten Tomatoes last night, it did so to a score of just 6%. That was enough to see it swoop in underneath Borderlands as this month's worst film. Cue much celebration at [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/) and movie distributor [Lionsgate](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/lionsgate/), presumably.

Unfortunately, any of those celebrations were to be short-lived, as The Crow saw its own gradual improvement, with its overall score rising from that initial 6% to the dizzying highs of 24% critical approval. That's hardly a glowing reception, but it's enough to see The Crow clamber back over Borderlands and avoid the bottom spot.

It's been a tricky run for the Borderlands movie - terrible reviews don't often make for excellent box office returns, and the movie's still running about $90 million shy of its $110 million budget. Possibly as a result of that, [<u>Borderlands is reportedly about to turn its back on cinemas</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/barely-3-weeks-after-its-dollar90m-flop-the-borderlands-movie-is-reportedly-giving-up-on-cinemas-and-going-straight-to-streaming/), heading to streaming at the end of this month after only three weeks in cinemas. In turn, that saw [<u>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford doing a bit of what we in the industry refer to as 'posting through it'</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-ceo-is-posting-through-the-films-dollar100m-flop-with-another-borderlands-4-hint-teasing-were-working-extra-hard-four-you-on-whats-next/), but that did actually appear to pay off - the reveal of [<u>Borderlands 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-guide/) earlier this week has been hailed as perhaps [<u>Pitchford's greatest "big brain move" thanks to its ability to distract from the movie's critical and commercial failure</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/putting-the-borderlands-4-reveal-just-2-weeks-after-the-borderlands-movies-dollar90m-flop-is-being-hailed-as-randy-pitchfords-ultimate-big-brain-move/).
