That famous Halo 2 demo from E3 2003 is finally going to be playable later this year.

More than a year before Halo 2 hit store shelves, publisher [Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) debuted a full-fat nine-minute demo of the game at E3 2003 that made the already hyped shooter an even bigger event. But the entire demo's mission and ideas like the winding city highways never saw the light of day and were scrapped as [Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bungie/) made last minute changes to the game.

There was never any reason to think the scrapped 'Earth City' mission would rear its head again - that is, until [343 Industries](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/343-industries/) and Digsite, a team focused on restoring content from the fabled FPS series, announced that [the demo's contents would be making a free comeback in Halo: The Master Chief Collection](https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-2s-lost-earth-city-demo-will-be-playable-for-the-first-time-in-the-master-chief-collection/) via Steam workshop.

At this weekend's Halo World Championship Series 2024, 343i revealed the demo would be revived for Halo 2's 20th anniversary on November 9, alongside a first look at its remade Earth City linked below - a fun little peek at what could've been. The updated demo will also come with overhauled lip sync in the demo's cutscenes, added waypoint markers to the map in case you want to go off-script, and will obviously use assets from Halo 2's release build.

That wasn't the only exciting announcement from the Halo-centric event either. 343i unveiled an [upcoming third-person mode for Halo Infinite](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/halo/halo-infinite-third-person-is-officially-happening-after-years-of-fan-requests-343-reveals-with-a-surreal-gameplay-video/), satisfying a decades-old prophecy from when Steve Jobs first revealed Halo 1 at MacWorld 1999 in all its once-third-person glory. A team of Forgers also[ set a date for their Helldivers 2-like mode in Halo Infinite](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/halo/the-forged-helldivers-2-mode-in-halo-infinite-is-exactly-what-both-games-need-and-its-coming-to-the-fps-this-month/).

[<em>Halo: Combat Evolved is reportedly getting “some form” of a remaster as Xbox considers bringing the FPS series to PlayStation.</em> ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/halo/halo-combat-evolved-is-reportedly-getting-some-form-of-a-remaster-as-xbox-considers-bringing-the-iconic-fps-series-to-ps5-for-the-first-time/)
