One former [Rockstar Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/rockstar-games/) animator with credits on GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 reckons that [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/) is "probably" playable start-to-finish with the studio mainly focused on squashing any pesky bugs and glitches that might surface.

That comes from former Rockstar Games developer Mike York, in a now unlisted interview with Kiwi Talkz, who speculated about the state of the studio's newest blockbuster slated to come out this year. With Rockstar Games' history of high-profile delays, there's been lots of chatter around whether GTA 6 will also slip into next year, but York thinks the team are close to the finish line.

"They're probably still making a few new things here and there or adding to things here and there, of course, but I would assume that the game's probably playable now, and a bunch of people are testing the whole thing all the way through," he guessed. "There's probably a ton of bugs" - as is the case with crowded open-world games still in development - "and they're fixing all those bugs, and they're trying to find more bugs, and they're trying to find as many bugs as they can before they release because a game like GTA is unlike any other game."

York even said that, during his time working on GTA 5, the team "played the game all day, every day for, like, 8-to-10 hours a day." York also explained how creating a huge, densely-populated game, such as[ GTA 6, differs from something like The Witcher 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/making-an-open-world-game-like-gta-6-bug-free-is-a-lot-different-than-something-like-the-witcher-3-says-former-rockstar-dev/) as players can get up to all sorts of antics that the developers simply can't anticipate during production.
