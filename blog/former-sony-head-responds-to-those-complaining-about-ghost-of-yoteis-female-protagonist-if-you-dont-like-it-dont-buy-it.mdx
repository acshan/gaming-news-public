Following the big [<u>Ghost of Yotei</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ghost-of-yotei-guide/) reveal during [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/)'s recent [<u>PlayStation State of Play</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/ps5-playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-live-reaction-everything-announced/) event, some have taken to criticizing the [<u>Ghost of Tsushima</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ghost-of-tsushima-guide-walkthrough/) sequel for its female protagonist - and former [<u>Sony</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) lead Shawn Layden is having absolutely none of it.

Responding to a [<u>thread</u>](https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672) doing the rounds, Layden claps back saying that Ghost of Yotei was made to suit developer Sucker Punch's vision for the follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima: "It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this." He reiterates that "it's a game," and if anyone isn't a fan of it then they can simply not purchase it.

1 It's a game. An entertainment. A story a team of creators believes in. They want to make this.2 it's a game. If you don't like it, don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?[September 25, 2024](https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden/status/1838781831010754672)

"If you don't like it," Layden writes, "don't buy it. In fact, why not make the game you want yourself?" He makes a valid point, and one that many agree with. Amid complaints about the Ghost of Yotei protagonist, many more fans are excited about the sequel and the possibility of a female samurai. One discusses "the history and legacy of samurai women," [linking](https://x.com/pinkprincessin1/status/1838788847640903991) to a relevant historical study.

Another [points](https://x.com/sebBaku/status/1838786764011348445) fans toward documents on the onna-bugeisha or onna-musha, female warriors from pre-modern Japan who often fought alongside samurai men - and even led them. There's no telling just yet what path Ghost of Yotei will take with its plot, though, but a setting in Hokkaido [<u>over 300 years after</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-ghost-of-yotei-announced-for-2025-sucker-punchs-next-open-world-samurai-game-is-set-400-years-later-and-stars-a-female-lead-in-hokkaido/) the events from Ghost of Tsushima points to a possible tale of the Ainu people settled within the region.
