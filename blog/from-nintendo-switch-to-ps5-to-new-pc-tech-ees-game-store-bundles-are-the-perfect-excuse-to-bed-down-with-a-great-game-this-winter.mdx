With winter officially around the corner, it might be time to embrace that feeling to bed down and get cozy with a great new game - and thankfully, with its [<u>EE Game Store</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-5144032422801200880&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ee.co.uk%2Fgaming) bundles, EE is here to make that happen.

As the nights get longer and the temperatures get colder, this time of year can feel a bit more difficult than normal. Cold mornings and dark nights mean that it's harder to motivate yourself to get out and about for exercise or socializing, which can lead to 1 in 15 people experiencing season affective disorder, and as many as 20% of people saying they tend to suffer from the 'winter blues'.

At this time of year, shaking up your daily routine can be helpful from shaking off those blues - but if you'd rather do that by getting cozy than braving the elements, EE has an array of different Game Store bundles to help you find the gaming passion project that will help the months fly by until the spring.

If you're looking to stave off the winter blues with something bright, colorful, and filled with you, then look no further than EE's Nintendo Switch bundles. You can get a [<u>Nintendo Switch console, with a EE GameCard voucher</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-4534903385808570233&p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fatp-nintendo-switch-console-ee-gamecard-bundle) to allow you to pick a game of your choosing - so whether you're a fan of Mario, Zelda, Pikachu, or any of Nintendo's other iconic characters, you won't be disappointed. And with 24 months of Nintendo Switch Online, you'll be able to have your friends join the party too. Alternatively, if you're a die-hard fan of a certain moustachioed plumber, you can grab yourself a [<u>Nintendo Switch OLED bundle with a copy of Super Mario Bros Wonder</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-1319251718084229289&p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-24m-bundle-with-super-mario-bros-wonder-and-more).

If you fancy using those longer nights to really bed in on the latest great RPG, however, look to one of EE's PS5 or Xbox Series bundles. EE's offering three different [<u>PS5 Pro bundles</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-9968809759226748241&p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation5-pro-24-month-bundle-with-250v-70-gamecard-and-more), allowing you to make your pick without sacrificing the graphical fidelity offered by the latest PlayStation console. Or, if you're an Xbox fan, you can grab an [<u>Xbox Series X with a huge Â£150 GameCard</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-2162302411823631077&p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fatp-xbox-series-x-console-ee-gamecard-bundle), allowing you to build up your new game library from scratch. And if you want to be *truly* immersed, you can take the plunge into VR with the [<u>Meta Quest 3S Mixed Reality Headset bundle</u>](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=31423&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-9180431372219781039&p=https%3A%2F%2Fee.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fmeta-quest-3s-mixed-reality-headset-24-month-bundle-with-50-ee-gamecard-and-more), complete with Batman Arkham Shadows, so you can lose yourself in Gotham.

Grabbing your favorite new game is a great way to take advantage of EE's Game Store bundles, but if you're not 100% sure what you want just yet, then those GameCard's are a great way to pick up some of 2024's best games. Many of biggest winners and nominees at the prestigious Golden Joystick Awards 2024 - like roguelike sensation Balatro, delightful platformer Astro Bot, and the awards' biggest winners, Black Myth Wukong and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth - can all be accessed via EE (some PlayStation-exclusive games must be accessed via PlayStation currency purchased with your GameCard).

Those are just some of EE's Game Store bundles - there are dozens of alternatives to allow you to pick your perfect bundle, based on your favorite games, hardware, or even the ability to craft your new collection for yourself. No matter what you're looking for, if you want a way to shake off the winter blues while staying comfy and cosy indoors, EE's got you covered.
