Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) seems to be firmly in its multiplayer era with the announcement of its new game, [The Duskbloods](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-duskbloods-is-coming-exclusively-to-switch-2-in-2026-and-it-looks-it-is-to-bloodborne-as-elden-ring-was-to-dark-souls/).

The Duskbloods was one of the biggest surprises of the [Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. ](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/)I don't think I ever would have had a Nintendo-exclusive FromSoftware game on my bingo card, but I certainly wouldn't have had that FromSoftware game being a development on the longshot that was [Elden Ring: Nightreign](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-guide/).

Nightreign, you may remember, is a three-player multiplayer experience (though you can play it solo, but not in pairs). Continuing along that theme, The Duskbloods is a "PvPvE-based multiplayer action game" for up to eight players, according to a post on [FromSoft's website](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/article/250402_1.html) (translated via [Google](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/google/)). Now, my personal vendetta against almost all kinds of extraction shooter (I'm of the opinion that Escape from Tarkov, Dark and Darker, and Hunt: Showdown 'completed' this particular genre) means that I'm not super-down for that, but what I am interested in is the fact that this is a newly-emerging pattern for FromSoft.

Of course, there's been multiplayer in Dark Souls for years, but the entire Soulsborne 'series' is certainly multiplayer-first. [Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/) blurred those lines, but Nightreign started the process of erasing them entirely. Now, The Duskbloods is a whole new IP (despite how much it looks like Bloodborne) based entirely around that multiplayer setup. It's not an optional extra like Elden Ring's, but clearly a core part of the experience. That marks a whole new frontier for this acclaimed studio, and it's one that I'm fascinated to see play out.
