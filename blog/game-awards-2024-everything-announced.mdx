In a clearly important update deserving of its own entry, Final Fantasy 16's Ben Starr will be in attendance at The Game Awards tonight. He also appears to have learned his lesson.

And now, a changing of the guard! A fond farewell to deputy news editor Iain Harris as he departs for a much-deserved rest.I (US managing editor Rollin Bishop) will be your guide into the depths of The Game Awards proper from here on in. Get comfy; we've got some ways to go yet as the preshow proper doesn't even start for nearly three hours yet.

Only just over 3 hours until #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/4J4U6XajJv[December 12, 2024](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867317517192245351)

I don't know about you, but I'm personally interested in the game reveals that we don't know about yet. Partly because I'm nosy, but also because Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier has said on [Kinda Funny Games Daily](https://www.youtube.com/live/j8_XQdX8cEE?si=cnAbNneH-0dGjNfL&t=2032) that â€œthere are at least two things that will make you guys, reacting, say â€˜holy shit, I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s here.'"

What's excellent news for a few fandoms likely means three-inch deep clown makeup for everyone else, but I am ready.

We're getting to see some Game Awards royalty tonight as [It Takes Two director Josef Fares is popping up to reveal his next game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/its-impossible-to-not-be-cocky-when-you-have-a-game-like-this-it-takes-twos-josef-fares-is-back-and-drumming-up-another-game-awards-reveal/) and hopefully say something on camera he shouldn't.

"A lot of people say I'm cocky, but it's impossible to not be cocky when you have a game like this in front of you," he says. "I'm telling you. You will see what I mean when you play it."

I don't know when we'll actually play what the team is working on, but it sounds like we'll certainly be seeing it in a few hours time.

Now that we're getting closer to the show, more teases are rolling in. In fact, Sifu developer SlowClap says "expect to be surprised." What could the team be cooking?

One of tonight's award nominees has made a pre-show announcement, and, well, I think it's best you just watch the clip.

Back to the actual Game Awards, one game we know we're seeing is Borderlands 4. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford initially told us all about the [new trailer sooner than he was allowed to](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/next-borderlands-4-trailer-is-badass-af-says-gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-even-though-hes-not-supposed-to-talk-about-it-yet-im-freaking-out-yo/), but has since shared more â€“ with The Game Awards' blessing, we presume. Expect ["a lot of in-game footage"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4s-reveal-this-week-includes-a-lot-of-in-game-footage-and-a-sick-never-before-seen-original-cinematic-sequence-thatll-bridge-the-gap-between-borderlands-3/) and "a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence" that'll bridge the gap between Borderlands 3.

If you're looking for something a wee bit different from The Game Awards, an indie is kicking off [The Game Awards for Games Who Can't Afford the Game Awards](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/in-an-attempt-to-promote-its-own-indie-roguelike-one-developer-accidentally-created-an-alternative-to-the-game-awards-for-devs-who-cant-afford-thousands-of-dollars-for-a-trailer-spot/) tomorrow. The show will spotlight over 70 indie games across various genres and hand out some very serious awards â€“ like the 'Most Likely to Make You Quit Your Job and Become an Artist' prize. Serious business.

Phew! After going over all the nominees, you can see why The Game Awards last as long as they do - especially when you factor in the musical acts and trailers. If you haven't been counting, Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth lead on nominations with seven each. Then you've got Metaphor: ReFantazio with six, and so on.

As for who the big winners might be, FF7 Rebirth and Helldivers 2 won big at [this year's Golden Joysticks](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/here-are-all-the-golden-joystick-awards-2024-winners/), so I wouldn't be surprised to see the same here. Mind you, Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is running in more categories here, so that'll likely influence how it all plays out. As ever, we need only wait and see.

Why yes, that is Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree among the gang. A first for The Game Awards, expansions and the like are up for the top prize this year.

Before we continue, here are the nominees from all the major categories.

We're due to get a "full world premiere reveal" of Mafia: The Old Country at the big show, though a [YouTube ad may have given away the release window](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/mafia-the-old-country-trailer-summer-2025-release-window/). Interestingly, if that window turns out to be true, then the game might not be too far away from another Take-Two published game, GTA 6.

And we're off! We've still got some time until the show kicks off so if you've not done that run to the shop to stock up on snacks, now is the time.
