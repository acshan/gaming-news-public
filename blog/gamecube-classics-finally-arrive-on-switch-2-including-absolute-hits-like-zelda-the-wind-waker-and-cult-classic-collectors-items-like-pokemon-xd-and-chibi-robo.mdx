After fans spent years begging for GameCube games on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo has confirmed that some of the console's most notable classics (and some extremely expensive collector's items) are both coming to [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/).

The GameCube library will be part of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, and it launches the same day as the Switch 2 console. The initial library includes Nintendo's own games The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and F-Zero GX. Plus, [Bandai Namco](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bandai-namco/)'s Soulcalibur 2, which includes Link from The Legend of Zelda as a playable fighter. The games will support online play too, which is a game-changer for F-Zero and Soul Calibur 2.

However, things got really interesting when Nintendo showed titles that are coming in the future. You have your obvious picks like Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Strikers, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokemon Colosseum as future releases. However, games that are massive rarities like Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Chibi-Robo are also confirmed to be on the way so you no longer have to spend over $200 ([according to Pricecharting](https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gamecube/chibi-robo)) to experience one of Nintendo's best hidden gems. Although shockingly, there was no mention of the system's best-selling game: Super Smash Bros. Melee.

Another brilliant feature of the GameCube app is the ability to rebind your controls in the app. This was a big problem on the original Nintendo Switch Online apps as you would need to do this from your system settings. Considering the GameCube's weird button layout, this will undoubtedly help some games feel more natural on Nintendo Switch 2 controllers.

Like the other consoles available, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be getting it's own version of the Gamecube controller. This controller will be wireless and feature a ZL and C button to allow it to be used with other games an access [the Nintendo Switch 2's chat functions.](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-nintendo-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-is-an-in-built-nintendo-discord/) However, the [Nintendo UK website says](https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/221109/1889570/22585?subId1=grd-us-3004348219838725053&sharedId=grd-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fnintendo-switch-2) this controller will only be available initially for people who are invited by Nintendo to pre-order the Switch 2.
