Games like Terraria don't come around too often – this 2D, side-on survival crafter took the gaming world by storm well over a decade ago, and it's become a sandbox titan that's stuck around with plenty of updates. Whether you're digging through the upper crust to brave the dangers below, or traversing the colorful lands above, there's always loads to get stuck into as you mine resources, chop up wood, and, of course, battle all the monsters you can find. All while improving your gadgets and gizmos to make yourself even better at all of the above.

Re-Logic really nailed it with Terraria, and have known how to keep a good thing going. There's so much freedom, and so much creativity that goes beyond mere survival. Yet, even so, sometimes you want to shake things up and try something a little different. There are other games out there that put their own spin on the genre, or just offer the same kind of vibes with a fresh take. Whether it's the crafting, survival, exploration, or combat, here's a list of games like Terraria that you might enjoy (ahem) digging into next.



Developer: Dekovir EntertainmentPlatform(s): PC

Described by developers Dekovir Entertainment as a mix between Dungeon Keeper, Terraria and Dwarf Fortress, Craft the World is a strategy sandbox game that sees you control a band of dwarves. Naturally that means an increased focus on all things underground as you command them to make the most of a procedurally generated island. With a day and night cycle, there's plenty of secrets to find. Dangerous portals can also pop up in the world that will spew hordes of dangerous monsters out, so you better be ready to defend you dwarf tribe. From treasure hunting, to being the very best architect you can be, the dwarf vibes add to that Terraria feeling wonderfully. Though this one is also over a decade old, updates are still coming into 2025!



Developer: DreamlitPlatform(s): PC, PS5

Towers of Aghasba might be 3D, but just like Terraria it also plays with the verticality of its space, though instead of digging down, Dreamlit's take on a survival crafter has you gliding among massive flying creatures. While a lot of the basic genre features in Terraria are also present here, the focus in Towers of Aghasba is very much on exploring and maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Currently in early access, there's still plenty of heights left for this game to soar to, but we've been most impressed so far by what's on the horizon to discover next in this weird and wonderful world, which is very much the focus over survival. With some more updates under its belt, this is set to be a real contender.

With a gorgeous pixel art aesthetic and a split dynamic between underground and overground activities, [Stardew Valley](https://www.gamesradar.com/stardew-valley-guide/) has more in common with Terraria than it may initially seem. How you manage your farm and connect with the surrounding villagers also depends heavily on your ability to craft and manage resources. Just, here, everything is a bit more delineated, meaning you focus more on specific types of tasks at certain times rather than coming up against uncertainty constantly. Which is all to say this might be a fantastic way to extend the feeling of playing Terraria into a new and more chill direction for you. And, let's face it, we can't not recommend Stardew Valley, right? With constant updates, there's never been a better time to embrace the farm life.



Developer: Klei EntertainmentPlatform(s): PC

Made by the same developers behind Don’t Starve, Oxygen Not Included is a space-colony sim with some elements that are quite reminiscent of those in Terraria. In a subterranean asteroid in space, you have to help your colony’s population grow and thrive by mining resources, and crafting structures and gadgets to help them prosper. From resource management to exploration and temperature control, everything is left entirely up to you. As you build bases, you’ll learn what you need to keep your colony alive. Certain constructions are also vital in order to help stave off illness, and, more importantly, deliver a supply of oxygen to your inhabitants.

While the experience of playing [Valheim](https://www.gamesradar.com/valheim-guide/) is a bit different to that of Terraria, many of its features may well appeal to fans of Re-Logic's sandbox adventure. In its procedurally-generated setting inspired by Viking culture, you'll have to try to survive its dangers by gathering resources to craft armor, weapons, tools, and even ships to bolster you defences. You can also build up your own Viking longhouses and customize them to keep yourself safe. With boss battles to conquer, it also supports online co-op so you can try to survive purgatory with pals, not unlike the co-op in Terraria. 



Developer: Klei EntertainmentPlatform(s): PC, Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch 

Klei Entertainment's dark adventure is one of the [best survival games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-survival-games/), but with its vast world to explore and crafting elements it does shares some similarities with Terraria. In the bleak wilderness filled with weird creatures and hidden dangers, you play as Wilson, a scientist who’s been thrown into this strange world. You have to adapt to this new environment and make use of whatever you can find across the landscape in order to survive. By collecting resources and discovering new areas, you can craft and build new inventions that will help you stay safe in this unforgiving world and survive whatever’s thrown at you. You’ll have to hunt, research, and even fight to keep going. Lots of dangers lurk in the darkness, so having a light source is vital. [Don’t Starve](https://www.gamesradar.com/dont-starve-survival-guide/) is packed full of character and presents plenty of challenges to offer you a slightly different kind of experience with some familiar features.

Developer: [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) / Koei Tecmo GamesPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch

As another sandbox crafting game with exploration and combat, Dragon Quest Builders 2's distinctive style and refreshing take on the genre is a great alternative. The polished sequel to Dragon Quest Builders sees you take on the role of a young apprentice who sets out to become a builder after a cult known as the Children of Hargon set out to get rid of all oft he creators in the world. As a delightful RPG with resource gathering, crafting, farming, combat, and more, many of its features share similarities with Terraria. It's fantasy blocky world is ripe for creativity and exploration, too.

The way you engage with Palworld is quite different to Terraria, but it elicits many of the same feelings a good Terraria session does – a sense of discovery, of mastery over a space, of learning and implementing systems to turn what was at first a struggle into something much easier. Filled with monsters, you don't just battle them in Palworld, but collect and use them too. Rather than simply tipping the cap to classic monster collectors, though, these all feed right back into the survival and crafting loop, each new Pal helping you explore over the next horizon. This world is truly huge, and there's always something new – helped along by the fact that several hefty updates have already vastly improved and expanded what's on offer here.

While it’s uniquely different in its own way, Starbound’s style and gameplay elements will appeal to any Terraria fan. After you flee from your homeworld, you find yourself lost in space, and your ship is in very bad shape. So, you begin by landing on the nearest planet and working to find resources to get your ship back in working order. Once you can take flight again, you’re free to set off and explore all of the pixelated worlds across the universe to your heart's content. While there is a main story campaign you can progress through as you explore, you’re free to decide how you want to play. From collecting resources, to building homes on new planets, and working your way through dungeons, you can also go up against dangerous intergalactic enemies to get your hands on rare treasures. With different modes to choose from, including casual mode, survival mode, and hardcore mode with permadeath, you can get very creative with how you chart your very own space faring adventure. 



Developer: MojangPlatform(s): PC, Xbox One, PS4, Nintendo Switch

If you loved the element of crafting, progression, and exploration in Terraria, [Minecraft](https://www.gamesradar.com/minecraft-review/) has all those elements in its own signature blocky sandbox world. There’s a lot of room for you to get creative, and you’ll find yourself spending countless hours mining and collecting resources to build more and more advanced structures, weapons, and items. There’s also of course a lot of opportunities to get stuck into some combat, with a whole host of monsters that appear when night falls. 

Just like Terraria, you can dig your way through many underground levels, hunt for treasure, and work to find rare resources that will let you craft any number of useful tools. You can also invite your pals to play with you, and put them to work building that dream castle you’ve set your heart of creating. It’s also always helpful to have some backup when some particularly pesky foes come out night to disrupt your building escapades. The world really is yours to craft and master in [games like Minecraft](https://www.gamesradar.com/games-like-minecraft/).
