First things first - the links you'll need. We're a few hours from launch, but you can catch Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 on  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT5ilwECdrA), [Twitch](https://t.co/Gk8em20OP6), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/1825216751254028288). You'll want to tune in at at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST if you want to catch the whole thing.

Ok, so what can we expect from Opening Night Live? Well, thankfully, our good friend Geoff has already given us a decent sense of some of the bigger titles that'll be making some kind of appearance. The official YouTube thumbnail for tonight's stream features [Call of Duty: Black Ops 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-guide/), [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/), Marvel Rivals, Dune : Awakening, [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-game-bethesda-guide/), and Sid Meier's Civilization 7.

So expect those, I guess.

We'll see different amounts of each of those games, of course. [Civilization 7 promises a 20+ minute deep dive gameplay reveal](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/were-finally-getting-a-civilization-7-gameplay-reveal-at-gamescom-and-a-whole-20-minute-deep-dive-at-that/). Historically, Call of Duty has shown off an early level at events like these, so expect some of the campaign, and a focus on the visuals as much as the gunplay. Marvel Rivals could offer up a release date or a new hero reveal. And I've got no idea what Capcom might bring to the table , but given the hype around Monster Hunter Wilds and its 2025 release, I'm very excited to find out. A release date, perhaps?

I'm expecting plenty of surprises, of course - Opening Night Live runs for two hours, and even with lengthy reveals from Call of Duty and Civilization, there'll be plenty of space for other announcements. As for what those might be, I couldn't say for sure, but I can make some educated guesses (read: rampant speculation).

Geoff Keighley and Hideo Kojima's long friendship is well-documented, and the latter has shown up at the former's showcases several times in the past few years. Koj's Twitter suggests he's still in Japan at the moment, but one very recent tweet leads me to think he might be plotting something.

pic.twitter.com/iM9giFuJCP[August 20, 2024](https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1825893612997193955)

Realistically, that's not much to go on. That image is so vague that it could simply mean that Kojima is practicing his photography. But it could also be a read that he's playing something. Given that he's also been back on his [Death Stranding 2 teasers this week](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hideo-kojima-drops-a-new-death-stranding-2-actor-teaser-but-fans-quickly-deduce-that-its-one-of-his-long-time-collaborators/), could this be a tease of a new build, or perhaps a new trailer? That's a reach, but it's unlike Kojima simply offer up a contextless photo with nothing deeper behind it.

Getting closer to reality, I'd be surprised if we didn't get something chunky from [Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/). This will be the Marvel-backed hero shooter's first major outing since its pretty successful beta, and given how busy the genre threatens to be right now, I'd be hoping to make a pretty big splash if I was the team behind the leading contender. A release date or a new hero do seem like the most obvious picks - a 2024 or early 2025 launch seem within reach, and the devs have been steadily rolling out some new faces over recent weeks.

I'm back into guessing territory here, but I can also see Ubisoft making a minor showing today. With both [Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/) and [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-red-guide/) really very close at this point, this is another chance for Ubisoft to get a whole heap of eyeballs on two of what promise to be some of the biggest games of the rest of the year. Outlaws is now only days away, and Shadows is stepping up the marketing, so ONL seems a natural beat.

Oh, and in case you missed the recent [Shadows trailer, you really should check out heavy-set protagonist Yasuke's freshly-dubbed 'Yeet of Faith'](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-dub-yasukes-clumsy-twist-on-the-series-iconic-leap-of-faith-his-very-own-yeet-of-faith/).

Helpfully, in the last 20 minutes or so, Geoff Keighley has given something of an update about what more we can expect. As well as all those games I mentioned earlier, the one that jumps out to me straight away is [Mecha Break, which is straight off the back of a 3-million player open beta](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/breakout-mech-game-finds-its-way-onto-1-million-steam-wishlists-after-holding-an-open-beta-that-nearly-3-million-players-turned-up-for/) that helped it gain a million Steam wishlists.

I'll be honest, that one nearly passed me by, and I only took proper notice as the beta was wrapping up, so I've got little sense of what to expect. There's no full launch date attached to Mecha Break yet, though, so fingers crossed on that front.

Also making an appearance tonight is Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero. In the true spirit of the anime, it's already been described as intensely unbalanced, [because you're not supposed to go into it expecting it to be an esports experience](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-delightfully-unbalanced-and-definitely-not-an-esports-game-so-the-devs-had-to-find-a-unique-approach-to-ranked-online/). With a release date just around the corner on October 11, I'd expect little more than a sizzle reel from this one - [though with 164 roster slots to fill, I'm sure there are still some Goku variants out there that Sparking Zero hasn't shown off yet](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/i-played-a-giant-ape-and-tore-down-a-city-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-and-i-havent-had-this-much-dumb-fun-in-a-fighting-game-since-the-2000s/).

Also on that list is [Diablo 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/diablo-4-guide/) and its upcoming [Vessel of Hatred](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-announces-october-release-date-in-gnarly-new-cinematic-that-will-have-you-reaching-for-the-sick-bag/) expansion. Also set to release in October (per a frankly disgusting trailer that aired during SGF back in June), Vessel of Hatred could just be the tool that cements Diablo 4's rocky first year into a more secure place and nails the game down as an all-timer.

Last month, we spoke to Blizzard about the game's new class, which is coming in with the expansion, and will serve as the first new addition to the mainline series in a decade. Fortunately, it might not throw you off too much, as [Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred class promises to be something of a mix of Rogue and Barbarian](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/diablo/inside-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-and-the-series-first-new-mainline-class-in-10-years-maybe-i-can-mix-my-barbarian-and-rogue-together/).

Hopping back, if you'll allow me, to Civilization 7, it seems we might have our first leak of the evening. No show is 100% watertight, and as much as Geoff might wish that wasn't the case, sometimes a few details sneak through.

This time, that's the [Civilization 7 release date](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/civilization-7-leak-release-date/). Notable (and accurate) leaker Billbil-kun tweeted this afternoon to say that the new iteration in the legendary 4X series will release on February 11. The surprisingly detailed leak also comes with information about pricing for various editions and platform versions, which to my mind lends it a little credence - potentially risking your reputation on something as specific as the price of the Collector's Edition seems something you wouldn't be willing to do unless you had something concrete to go on.

Back to Geoff's list, and there's two outings from Little Nightmares developer Tarsier. Offering up both Little Nightmares 3 and an unannounced "new game," the studio seems to be promising a big evening for fans of miserable little guys going sideways.

Big news for any big Indiana Jones fans attending this year's Gamescom in person. Stein, senior social media manager over at Xbox, is already hyping up the game's presence at the show - "the best booth I've ever seen us bring to Gamescom"? - sounds impressive!

No spoilers but this is the best booth I’ve ever seen us bring to Gamescom!!! pic.twitter.com/qbX3ZJoxBu[August 20, 2024](https://twitter.com/steinekin/status/1825903042811813944)

There's an interesting array of smaller projects on Geoff's list for later. He's been teasing horror experience The Beast is Coming today, and he also says we should be looking out for Squid Game: Unleashed, The First Berserker: Khazan, and Towerborne. That's all on top of "many new game announcements, surprises, and special guests." Perhaps I should have more faith in my Kojima prediction...

Squatting dragon-like on top of this list, of course, is [Black Myth: Wukong](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-guide/). The action RPG is extremely fresh on the scene having only launched overnight, and that means we'll probably see some kind of launch or accolade trailer - another example of a major release making the most of all of those ONL eyeballs.

What's different here is that Black Myth: Wukong is *popping off*. Right now, [it's extending its lead over Palworld and Counter-Strike 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/black-myth-wukong-player-count-surges-past-14-million-beating-elden-ring-gta-5-and-cyberpunk-2077s-peaks/), having surpassed both of those games - as well as, you know, Elden Ring, Dota 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, Baldur's Gate 3, and basically everything else - on its way to becoming the second highest-played game on Steam ever. Right now, only PUBG remains standing in its way. Personally, I can't see it gaining the million+ concurrents it needs to beat that record, but with a massive Chinese audience behind it, there's always a possibility.

If you want to get the rumor mill churning, then there's apparent word of a few more appearances. That 'The Beast is Coming' teaser could be something linked to Dying Light, according to YouTuber JorRaptor, who also further vindicates my suggesting that Kojima is secretly on a plane to Germany, with a claim of a Death Stranding 2 trailer. There could also be something new from Josef Fares, the Oscar-cursing director behind It Takes Two and A Way Out, as well as some kind of secret SEGA project. Mysterious.

Here’s what’s rumored to be at @geoffkeighley Gamescom Opening Night Live tonight:- Death Stranding 2: On the Beach trailer- The Beast is Coming (seemingly Dying Light related)- New Hazelight Studios game (from It Takes Two, A Way Out)- Secret SEGA game (rumored for Opening… pic.twitter.com/lnpzQeCCX7[August 20, 2024](https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1825903672066224153)

Rounding out that ever-present list are a few more notable titles. There's an RPG feast on the cards with Persona 3 Reload Episode Aigis, and [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-coming-and-its-everything-the-first-rpg-was-supposed-to-be-in-the-beginning/), as well as something for the Life is Strange fans thanks to [Lost Records: Bloom & Rage](https://www.gamesradar.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-from-the-creators-of-life-is-strange-involves-blending-reality-dreams-and-the-weirdness-of-the-unknown/).

We've got a bit of time to kill before the show, so if you're looking for some further reading on either of those last two games, look no further:

Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 promises to be far bigger than its predecessor, [with its main voice actor boasting that he recording 508 hours of dialogue](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-actor-behind-kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-main-character-recorded-508-hours-of-dialogue-over-127-sessions-for-the-rpg-sequel/). It'll also be staying ["true to the core RPG experience," according to its developer, even as it grows to twice the size as the original](https://www.gamesradar.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-twice-as-big-as-the-first-game-has-revamped-combat-to-make-it-more-accessible-but-stays-true-to-the-core-rpg-experience/) and aims for a little extra accessibility.

As for Lost Records: Bloom & Rage, [we spoke to developer Dont Nod back in April to get a better sense of the game's protagonist, choices, and story](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/life-is-strange-devs-talk-lost-records-bloom-and-rages-protagonist-story-and-choices-looking-at-the-world-is-a-big-part-of-the-interactivity-in-our-game/). In our chat with creative director Michel Koch and executive producer Luc Baghadoust, we uncovered a lot, and I'm hoping there's plenty more to come. 

The slightly unfortunate news is that Bloom & Rage did get its planned release date pushed back a bit, but the silver lining there is that [Dont Nod only moved the date so as not to clash with the new Life is Strange game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/og-life-is-strange-developer-delays-its-new-life-is-strange-style-adventure-to-dodge-the-actual-new-life-is-strange-game/). A bit of a gamedev 'thanks dad' moment, for you there.

As much as I'd love to stick around all evening, I can't stay glued to my chair for the next two hours. Never fear, however, we'll have a few more updates before the start of the show, which is when the live coverage begins in earnest. Ciao!

One thing you [<em>shouldn't</em> expect from ONL today is Hollow Knight: Silksong.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/dont-even-bother-with-the-clown-makeup-hollow-knight-silksong-wont-be-at-gamescoms-opening-night-live-show/) Geoff Keighley himself confirmed the long-awaited Metroidvania is not going to be at the show, as Team Cherry is "still cooking." Just go ahead and save the clown makeup for a different day - I'm sure you'll find a brilliant opportunity for it.

As Black Myth: Wukong continues to dominate Steam charts and industry conversations ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live, [many devs and analysts predict the instant-hit action RPG could change the nature of games in and from China](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/devs-and-analysts-predict-black-myth-wukong-could-change-games-in-china-wukong-is-proof-a-well-made-single-player-game-can-be-big/), with some calling it "proof a well-made single-player game can be big." We may well see another Chinese hit, Genshin Impact, at today's show, as developer HoYoverse is a recurring attendee for events like this, and [Genshin Impact has a massive update coming soon](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/genshin-impact-gives-out-its-first-free-5-star-character-as-update-50-pulls-out-the-big-guns-for-natlan-custom-made-artifacts-and-no-more-5050-odds-on-characters/). 

If you're one of the lucky people attending Opening Night Live in person, your luck might not have run out yet. Journalist (and friend of the Future Games Show) Jordan Oloman is in Cologne, where he says that 'Golden Geoff Tickets' are being handed out. The recipients will be one of 50 people invited to meet the Geoff-Man himself after the show. I wish that were me.

And speaking of Geoff, he's getting the hype building. Some fun things ahead, hmm?

Ok just about an hour until the live @gamescom show begins.Some fun things ahead tonight![August 20, 2024](https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825942265036210676)

You know something else that's happening in the gaming world tonight? The launch of Concord, Sony's upcoming hero shooter. Admittedly, this is only early access for the Deluxe Edition customers - standard edition players will be able to join in in a few days' time - but you have to admit this might not be the *best *timing ever. 

Black Myth: Wukong was already set to take names today, and ONL is probably going to soak up a lot of the rest of the attention. For a game that's somewhat struggled to build up a head of steam, Concord might have benefitted from a slightly less busy launch day. Nevertheless, despite a muted audience response so far, the critical reception hasn't been too bad, so perhaps Concord could surprise us.

If you're only just getting here, that's absolutely fine, because the main show is yet to start. But if you've been here a while, then you might have caught some of the pre-show, the main highlight of which appears to be this crossover between Dave the Diver, musician mxmtoon, alchemist simulator Potion Craft, and poker-style roguelike Balatro. No, I don't know how that all fits together either.

Dave the Diver - mxmtoon / Balatro / Potion Craft collab announced pic.twitter.com/Ko2PKCdwn6[August 20, 2024](https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1825949918630232203)

Street Fighter 6 trailer ends the preshow! And we're off to the actual races as Gamescom Opening Night Live begins in earnest.

Geoff Keighley takes the stage. I (US Managing Editor Rollin Bishop) am not qualified to speak about how he's dressed or the shoes he is wearing. I'm currently wearing a white T-shirt and basketball shorts.

Keighley out here hyping up the night despite all the struggles of the industry overall. Indiana Jones, Dune, all that jazz. You know 'em, you love 'em. He... is trying German. Emphasis on "trying."

2K Games first up and out. Keighley says it hasn't leaked!

Hello there, Borderlands 4! 2025. Looks to be... set in space? Or something? Just a tiny, little teaser showing off the iconic mask. Congratulations to Randy Pitchford.

Call of Duty Black Ops 6 is up. Call of Duty Next event will show off more, but they're here to talk about the upcoming game's campaign. The folks talking about it mean well, but the energy is low as we move into seeing "Most Wanted" from the game.

"Most Wanted" walks us through a political heist that feels a bit like Call of Duty playing Hitman. Honestly, if the rest of Black Ops 6 plays around with mission formula like this, I'd be happy as a clam.

But of course not everything goes to plan and "Pantheon" is here to cause trouble. While it seems like you're offered to go quiet or loud, the gameplay seems to indicate they've gone "loud."

They keep speeding through sections, which I assume is to leave some surprises, but all it does for me is make me have to keep typing as fast as my little fingers can go.

Big beefy minigun-wielding enemy is taken out by a *checks notes *RC car bomb. All right.

You know what? There are a lot of dark shadows in this showcase, but I overall actually quite like how the lighting looks. Congratulations to all the folks that contributed to that vibe.

I'm pretty sure main dude just threw a knife that he then controlled somehow. I don't care how it works; I just want to do it all the time.

Protagonist and the person he saved (?) zoom out of the frying pan and into the fire on motorcycles. There's more Fast and the Furious DNA here than I expected.

And we're done! Keighley introduces Sjokz to then introduce more stuff. (Shout outs to the EU LCS; real ones know.)

We're seeing a trailer for... something. There's a prison with awkwardly glitched characters and bugs.

T-pose bugs, clipping... there are all sorts. I have absolutely no idea what this could be for, but it certainly looks to do with all the ways games can be broken.

...is this Goat Sim?

Well, friends, it is in fact for Goat Simulator Remastered, coming 2024. I don't know, man. Sjokz, please, no more GOAT Goat Simulator jokes, I beg of you.

Persona 3 Reload up! Specifically, bit about the upcoming Episode Aigis DLC.

There's a Person 5 crossover? A challenge battle against the Phantom Thieves, it looks like. It was too brief to really fully understand.

Speaking of brief, we are immediately onto a new game. Techland, so says the trailer. Military folks wander around a forest in the dark looking for something, which seems to also be watching them.

Whatever it is, it absolutely whooped some folks and continues to whoop new folks in the trailer here. Our military friends keep getting picked off. "Every man has an animal within, if you push too much you might unleash the beast."

...is this Dying Light 2 DLC? It sure looks like it now.

Dying Light The Beast, new adventure with 20 hours of gameplay and open world. Seems like a new game entirely.

Black Myth: Wukong launch trailer is up now. It's showing off combat gameplay and some generally impressive-looking environments. There's nothing explicitly *new *new here, but I ain't mad about seeing the game in action another time.

Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is up! I would like to take this opportunity to say that I bring up this game to our news editor Ali Jones on a daily basis, and the face he makes at me for my shenanigans is worth every moment.

Anyway, this is just a new trailer showing more gameplay and cutscenes. Looks like a Budokai game, because it is.

I do *not *know what this weird trailer featuring animated Geoff is about. King of Meat, which it finally reveals, looks like a monstrous dungeon creator? Inspired choice to have "Insane in the Membrane" by Cypress Hill as the soundtrack to this, at least. 

Also animated Keighley bites it at the end of the trailer.

Some of the folks at FuzzyBot are here to talk about its new game, Lynked: Banner of the Spark. Co-op hack-and-slash with some town-building elements to "brawl, build, and befriend."

It seems nice? But I do feel like ONL could focus more on the showing rather than the telling, or at least telling after showing.

Yeah, see, the trailer here makes a much more compelling case for the game. Show me what the thing is and *then *tell me about what I saw.

Brief note about Gamescom Cares before a new look at Lost Records: Bloom & Rage. Classic Life is Strange-style gameplay, for what it's worth, with some fun characters and a compelling mystery. Some kind of I Know What You Did Last Summer problem with a package dredging up the past.

And we immediately move right on to yet another zombies game. No More Room in Hell 2 is coming soon. 8-player co-op is a tempting premise, even if I've played dozens of zombie games before.

And Geoff segues quickly to Arc Raiders. You might recall it having been [announced at December 2021's The Game Awards](https://www.gamesradar.com/arc-raiders-is-a-new-f2p-co-op-shooter-from-battlefield-and-battlefront-veterans/). It looked good then, and it looks good now! But not much meat on the bones of this teaser trailer, really.

Thank the Maker; Infinity Nikki trailer is here to seriously shift the energy of Gamescom Opening Night Live. I have absolutely no idea what is going on here (I thought Nikki was a dress-up game?) but it is bright and colorful and strange. That'll do me just fine.

Never mind we're back to dour; Warhammer Space Marine 2 is what Infinity Nikki bookends into. "Heed the call of war," it says. Sure. I can do that. Where you want me?

Predecessor, which you might know of because it came out of "the ashes of Epic Games' Paragon," is up. Sure looks like a MOBA shooter. Good luck with that and I wish you well.

Path of Exile 2! Looks like Path of Exile, but more. Which, I mean, yeah. If you're hungry for another action RPG in the vein of classic Diablo, there's frankly not much better than what Grinding Gear Games is up to. November 15, 2024 is the Early Access date.

"Gamescom is known for its cosplay," says Sjokz. I'll take your word for it.

Dune Awakening. I have awoken to awake to wakefulness as we see a bit discussing how the game begins. Hunted by sandworms and scorched by sun, you have to stay in the shade to survive for any length of time. Arrakis is dangerous, it turns out.

Dune Awakening walks through some combat and building. The showcase builds and then flies an ornithopter, which I mean whomst among us wouldn't fly one given the opportunity. It feels like the planet in general in a big selling point, and I wouldn't mind playing Arrakis Flight Sim for a good chunk of time.

We've seen a good bit of this before, at least behind closed doors, earlier this year. But it does mark the first time the public is seeing how all of this works. Looks neat! Do like Dune, do like being awake.

New game from the Little Nightmares folks is up now. Small folks running around in the dark. I'm not much of a spooky person, so Reanimal -- the title was just revealed as I was writing -- probably isn't for me. But it sure seems like it'll be for a lot of people! Again, the lighting was very good. Good job, lighting folks.

Genshin Impact is here now to show off more of Natlan, the new nation set to arrive in the coming weeks with the big 5.0 update. Bright, colorful, with lots of pop. Also apparently one of these new characters right a shark and the other is a gamer. So, there's that.

Genshin Impact is officially coming to Xbox Series X/S on November 20!

Monster Hunter Wilds is here! Hands-on demos happening at Gamescom, but we specifically are being treated to a new trailer.

What in the name of everything holy is this wild flower spider-lookin' monstrosity? I do not want any of that. (But it *was *very pretty.) And the footage of the camp here is nice and brown, just like I like to see.

More combat with the lightning-blasting wyvern thing. (Apologies to senior staff writer Austin Wood and also my brother; I'm not a hunter of monsters personally.) Looks deadly and cool.

The trailer ends with a black screen then a stinger of cooking. "So tasty!" Good, yes, exactly what I want.

Lara Croft is coming to Naraka Bladepoint on August 28. That's it; that's the news.

Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves will officially include Mai Shiranui, as if there were every any doubt. It ain't Fatal Fury without her.

And right into the next thing! Mecha Break, I believe, is showing off a whole mess of fast-paced gameplay. I'll take "multiplayer mech game" any day of the week.

Monument Valley 3 is on the way! First look here at ONL; coming to Netflix (from Netflix Games).

Lots of perspective puzzling in classic Monument Valley style. Lovely minimalist art and swapping around. Also apparently sailing about on lil boats? And there's a fish. Rude fish.

Exclusive to Netflix Games and releasing December 10, 2024.

Civilization 7 gameplay on the way, sounds like. Ed Beach, creative director on the game at Firaxis, is here to talk about.

"Civ 7 is by far the biggest, most ambitious game Firaxis has ever made," says Beach.

There's apparently a new in-game narrator, but we're not going to see that now. What we *are *going to see is the first real look! But first, a history lesson about Civilization. Dustin Bailey, eat your heart out.

Hex tiles? Yeah, that's Civ all right. Little people running around and ships and tanks and nuclear explosions and leaders and trains and templates and volcanoes and space rockets. History come alive, innit. Showcase after ONL tonight.

And now, immediately, Starfield. And more important, its new vehicle, the Rev-8! Mako this is not. Free update with that available tonight! Shattered Space DLC on September 30.

Marvel Rivals! New information! Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Black Panther all seen. This ain't beating the Marvel Overwatch allegations.

Cap says "I can do this all day," because of course he does. Also there's a tease that Doom is up to something, because of course Doom is up to something. He usually is!

Marvel Rivals launches December 6, 2024.

Gamescom Opening Night Live now turns to climate action. They recommend setting up energy-saving mode. Good tip.

I looked away for a moment and Tencent Games got an award? All right. Shout outs to Level Infinite.

Deadpool's Tim Miller is here dropping f-bombs to talk about how he and his love video games. 15 episodes, created in collaboration with Amazon Studios and publishers and developers of some of the greatest games. He is really getting choked up on stage here.

Amazon's Prime Video release date is December 10! You might recall this was [reported ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-shows/tim-miller-secret-level-new-amazon-video-game-anthology/), with sources claiming it'd be revealed exactly where it is.

...is that Mega Man? That looked like Mega Man.

Age of Mythology Retold trailer follows Secret Level. Sure looks like Age of Mythology Retold! And now on to Towerborne.

...and now we're off of Towerborne and onto a brown-colored shooter from Timi Studio Group. There's an alligator in the footage here for some reason, but otherwise this looks quite a bit like every Battlefield I've played for the last 10 years.

Ah, Delta Force. I see. Of course. Coming to Steam Next Fest in October ahead of Early Access later this year.

And we've on to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2! Lots of wielding power and influence, trying to recruit folks. Sure looks like Kingdom Come Deliverance, but a sequel. A surprising amount of riding horses in this footage, I must say.

Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 gameplay premiere tomorrow, August 21. Release date on February 11, 2025.

Zenless Zone Zero showing off a new area and characters. The game continues to *look *incredible. I just wish I enjoyed playing it more, but hey, at least Hoyoverse doesn't own every last waking moment of mine. The characters! The backgrounds! Serious style.

And now, more Hoyoverse! Honkai Star Rail showing some stuff and apparently there's a Fate Stay Night crossover coming in Q3 2025? Nice. (I do like and play this one, so I've been attacked.)

Batman Arkham Shadow, the VR game in the Arkhamverse, is here! First look at gameplay from developer Camouflaj. It does genuinely look like first-person Batman Arkham, so at least there's that. (RIP Kevin Conroy.)

Oh hey, it's Ratcatcher. October 2024 release. Everything but the actual HUD looks pretty solid. I've been burned by VR before, however.

And now, a new look at Little Nightmares 3 from Bandai Namco. Sure looks like a horror puzzler to me. It Takes Two, but make it terrifying. Given that vibe seems to be the Little Nightmares franchise's bread and butter, feels like maybe this is doing something right.

Developers of Far and publishers of Firewatch are up now with... something. I don't know. It looks a bit like Where the Wild Things Are but as a shepherd. Herdling is coming 2025.

Oh no. Oh no no no.

Peter Molyneux has just been welcomed to the stage. "He's back," shouts Keighley.

Molyneux is talking about taking bits and pieces from classics like Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, and Fable. World premiere of his next thing, Masters of Albion. Team of 20 working on this.

Speaking of taking bits from the classics, looks like the major aspect is to build cities and design everything from the clothing they where to the food they eat. "I can even feed them rats," the in-game footage trailer says. Cool.

At night, the monsters of Albion attack. You can actually swap from God Mode to a Third-Person Mode in order to get into the thick of things or swap back to unleash deadly powers.

Back during the day, Pete makes a bread sword because why not. But you don't *have *to be that silly. You can wishlist now on Steam.

And now, a Squid Game game that looks a lot like murder Fall Guys. The art style is pretty neat, at least.

Squid Game Unleashed is coming soon. Neat. I will play that.

Yen from Netflix's The Witcher is here as part of what looks to be Unknown 9, which I struggle to describe except it looks a little bit Forspoken, a little bit Warframe, and a lot of magical shenanigans.

Blizzard is here to talk about things! Johanna Faries, president, is talking about Warcraft milestones and such. World of Warcraft: The War Within global launch is August 26.

In-game events for Warcraft 30 with cool rewards and "creative ways" to celebrate Azeroth together. Newly announced Warcraft Direct on the way. "Nice surprises" coming to other Blizzard games. Faries shouts out the Overwatch 2 team with a collab in September.

Sylvanas skin for Widowmaker coming to Overwatch 2. All right. OK.

Now we're talking Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred. Looking at new mercenary companions. That's more like it.

...one of them can turn into a demon of sorts? Why bother showing me any of the others, Blizzard. We both know where my loyalties lie. The Pale Hand is apparently the name of the group of four, though.

Brent Gibson, game director of Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred, takes the stage.

"We are hard at work adding news to play, and new ways to grow in power -- like mercenaries," says Gibson. The team is also adding a new multilayered dungeon in addition to a co-op PvE dungeon. That... just sounds like an MMO raid? Isn't that an MMO raid?

The First Berserker: Khazan is up now. It is a third-person action RPG, seems like. Some stylized art goes a long way here, though the trailer makes combat look a little stiff. Code Vein but with a berserker? All right.

I blinked, argued about Keanu Reeves, and missed Ara, I think. And now we're already onto Dark and Darker Mobile. The trailer here makes it out to be a lot more goofy than I understood that game to be.

Animal Crossing-like on a floating rock? Where do I sign up, Floatopia?

All this really needs is a Sanrio collab and my entirely family will play absolutely nothing else. How dare you, NetEase. How dare you.

It's finally time: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is up Troy Baker talks about playing Indy. He says it's humbling to take on the role and that it's a dream come true. "A dream that I cannot wait for you to live yourself," says Baker.

Baker walks us through puzzles, whipping things, punching Nazis. You know, Indiana Jones stuff. The Great Circle covers the globe, it sounds like. But the fact that you have a little journal with extra details and a camera to take photographs is what's actually selling me.

"Hold on to your hat," says Baker after talking about how he can't wait for people to play it. Release date reveal!

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on December 9, 2024 for Xbox Series X/S and PC, Spring 2025 for PS5. Good on them.

One final reveal here at ONL. Assassin's Creed? Something else?

Nope! Mafia: The Old Country. More coming this December. It's a story set in 1900s Sicily during the origins of Mafia. Not much actually revealed about what to expect there.

And that's it! It's over! What are you all still doing here?

I think Keanu Reeves is in the new Armored Core adaptation, and I can't believe no one's saying anything about it

Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred revives the action-RPG series' 24-year-old tradition of letting you hire mercenaries to fight alongside you

My Gamescom excitement comes crashing down as my most-wanted open-world game is delayed to 2025: Hyper Light Breaker devs need more time to get it "polished"
