> Gaming website announces a shift from Disqus to Viafoura commenting system, seeking user feedback for improved experience.

On Wednesday, February 26, we will close down our current Disqus-based commenting system and transition to a new commenting platform powered by Viafoura.

What this means for you:

Thanks for being an essential part of our community. We’ll be looking for your feedback as we make the move and we’re excited to see how we can improve your commenting experience.
