Disaster is about to strike Earth, as a sentient gas cloud known as The End closes in to destroy the planet, when suddenly high-school student Doug is teleported away to the seemingly idyllic Galaxyland. As revealed during the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) at Gamescom Presented by Sid Meier’s Civilization® VII, you'll soon be able to take this journey for yourself, when Beyond Galaxyland launches across a range of formats on September 24.

Joined by his gun-toting guinea pig Boom Boom and a robot named MartyBot, it's up to Doug to discover the truth behind Galaxyland by exploring the various planets and assembling a rag-tag crew of specialists, as you won't be able to save this universe single-handed. And who knows – with the right members in your team, you might just be able to prevent the impending cataclysm happening a billion lightyears away on Earth.

Galaxyland is a solar system featuring a diverse range of planets, from lush jungles and frozen tundra to bustling neon-soaked cities, with each presenting their own environmental puzzles and challenges. The game spans a range of genres, so you'll initially explore them as a platformer to complete quests, before switching to tactical turn-based combat when it comes to fighting enemies – you can even capture many of the unusual creatures you meet on your travels, to unleash their unique abilities later in battle. 

This adventure is presented in a striking pixel art style, while paying homage to many of the classic sci-fi films and RPGs from years gone by, so as you progress there will be plenty of references to enjoy if you can spot them. With a cast of wild characters to meet and over 25 boss battles to achieve victory in against the universe's most wanted foes, there's plenty to keep you going here.

Beyond Galaxyland is set for release on September 24 across PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, and you can [wishlist it now on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1543710/Beyond_Galaxyland/) to keep yourself posted on all of the latest developments.
