Borderlands 3 studio CEO Randy Pitchford wished [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/) could have made "big campaign DLC" for Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, but says the dev couldn't spare the resources from [Borderlands 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-guide/).

In a tweet last week, Pitchford responded to claims that Wonderlands had flopped. While the original message referred more to endgame support for the franchise spin-off than its sales, Pitchford said that the latter was solid, and that "Wonderlands was extremely far from a flop."

The lack of post-launch support for Wonderlands, however, seems to weigh relatively heavy on Pitchford's shoulders, as he goes on to say that "I wish we could've managed some big campaign DLC, but [there was] no way to do that *and* put the focus on Borderlands 4 that we needed to."Â 

Gearbox gave the impression that Tiny Tina's Wonderlands' success came as a big surprise - after its release in 2022, the company said that [the spin-off had "shattered all of our target expectations" and become a massive financial success](https://www.gamesradar.com/more-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-already-in-the-works-as-gearbox-calls-it-a-new-franchise/). Even back then, it was made clear that more Wonderlands was on the horizon, but it seems as though there simply wasn't time to commit to major expansions.

Pitchford himself [was hinting at a new Borderlands game](https://www.gamesradar.com/gearbox-ceo-hints-at-new-borderlands-projects/) as early as 2021, and one developer tweet suggests that [the ideas behind Borderlands 4 were already in place when Wonderlands launched](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/randy-pitchford-wasnt-the-only-one-teasing-borderlands-4-because-another-gearbox-developer-basically-spoiled-the-reveal-trailer-2-years-ago/). Pitchford says he's "so sorry" he wasn't able to talk about the situation around Wonderlands at the time, complaining that "the world is the world" - big new reveals tend to be planned out, and not simply tweeted because they're getting in the way of spin-off DLC. Either way, in spite of the movie, it seems as though the future of Borderlands video games remains pretty bright.
