Borderlands 3 is officially five years old as of today, September 13, and developer [Gearbox](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/gearbox/) is celebrating the milestone with another Shift Code dishing out a bunch of free loot. You have until October 13 to redeem it, and this code is only good for Borderlands 3, unlike [<u>the "most valuable" code in the series' history</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/the-borderlands-series-most-valuable-shift-code-ever-is-now-available-for-everyone-all-thanks-to-genius-fans-cracking-a-secret-code-that-im-baffled-was-solved-so-fast/), which was recently uncovered by fans. 

Here's the code: 

This code is good for five golden keys and five diamond keys. As ever, golden keys let you unlock the golden chest, while diamond keys are good for a whole room worth of loot. Once you're in the diamond room, you can only pick one piece of gear from the shield, gun, and grenade sections. You're also on a five minute timer, so choose quickly and choose wisely. At the end, a central kiosk will pop up with a guaranteed piece of Legendary gear, so while it's not the biggest code ever, this anniversary gimme is still a pretty solid chunk of loot. 

"Happy 5th Anniversary, Vault Hunters!" the Borderlands Twitter account [<u>said</u>](https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1834623420732223534). "Thanks to the greatest community in the galaxy – we’re excited to have you along for Borderlands 4." 

[<u>Borderlands 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-guide/) is officially out of the bag, but details on the upcoming sequel are still relatively thin. Unsurprisingly, Borderlands 4 will add "4 brand-new Vault Hunters," and [Gearbox seems to be pushing for more depth in the new classes](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-will-add-4-brand-new-vault-hunters-and-the-devs-want-classes-to-add-depth-to-the-rpg-mechanics-but-not-at-the-cost-of-complexity/). We also know that, despite some fan theories, Handsome Jack is well and truly dead, and [<u>the game's reveal trailer is actually teasing something "far more dangerous." </u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-4-studio-ceo-randy-pitchford-says-thats-not-handsome-jack-in-the-trailer-its-something-far-more-dangerous/)

There's certainly more interest around the Borderlands games than the movie, [<u>which recently limped out of theaters after a reported $115 million net loss</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/the-borderlands-movie-limps-out-of-theaters-with-a-reported-dollar115-million-loss-for-gearbox-and-lionsgate-after-a-run-of-just-dollar30-million/). Eager for Borderlands 4, some fans have already begun the video game sequel-mandated arc of behaving very normally, with one modder [<u>making their own Borderlands 4 by playing the four previous mainline games at the same time</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/someone-has-decided-that-playing-four-borderlands-games-with-one-controller-is-a-good-idea-actually/). 

[<u><em>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford wanted Tiny Tina's Wonderlands campaign DLC, but there was "no way to do that and put the focus on Borderlands 4 that we needed to."</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchford-wanted-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-campaign-dlc-but-there-was-no-way-to-do-that-and-put-the-focus-on-borderlands-4-that-we-needed-to/)
