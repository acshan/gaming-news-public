The Genshin Impact 4.6 codes are here, and that means various freebies alongside the usual excitement-building reveals of what content is coming next and what new and returning characters you'll be wishing for when the banner comes. 

Here, though, we're all about the [Genshin Impact codes](https://www.gamesradar.com/genshin-impact-codes-redeem/). If you're new, they provide a significant boost to your travels as they provide things like Primogems, Mora, Hero's Wit, Adventurer's Experience, and more. A word to the wise, though – they expire after 24 hours, so you'll want to take advantage sooner rather than later. 

That's where we come in. As a long-standing tradition, the Genshin Impact developers will share several codes randomly throughout its reveal streams, this latest one focusing on the 4.6 update. You could scribble them down while watching, though if you blink you may miss one. As such, we're listing them below for you.

If you're wondering how to redeem those new Genshin Impact codes, we recommend one of two methods. The first involves launching the game, opening the in-game menu, selecting 'settings,' then 'account,' and, finally, choosing 'redeem now' before entering the code. Once that's done, head to your in-game mailbox and enjoy.

The second and likely easier option requires going to the [Mihoyo code site](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift), logging in, and pasting a code into the box before selecting 'redeem.' Like before, you'll want to head to the in-game mailbox to get your goodies.
