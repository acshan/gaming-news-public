The Genshin Impact 4.7 codes are coming thick and fast, and that's because of a special livestream that illuminates what's next for the open-world gacha RPG. 

Now, the promise of new content is always exciting. The usual drip marketing offering has long confirmed suspicions that we're getting five-star characters Clorinde and Sigewinne, with four-star Sethos making their debut in support of one of them. Also, Genshin Impact is finally removing the open-world RPG's single [most annoying FOMO goblin](https://x.com/GenshinImpact/status/1793107073896743138) by increasing the Resin cap. 

But that's not why we're here. The other highlight of a [Mihoyo](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/mihoyo/) livestream is the handing out of [Genshin Impact codes](https://www.gamesradar.com/genshin-impact-codes-redeem/). They prove popular as they offer Primogems, Mora, Hero's Wit, Adventurer's Experience, and more. All handy things you'll need on your travels – or if you'd like to wish upon a banner to get a character without spending all your real-life money. 

The codes themselves can sometimes be easy to miss. You never know when they'll pop up; sometimes, they do so for longer than others. That's why we're putting this article together, so you can check in on the off chance you'll miss something. On that note.

If you're looking to redeem these codes for yourself, the easiest way is to go to the [Mihoyo code site](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/gift), log in, and paste the code into the box before selecting 'redeem.' Once that's done, just go to your mailbox in-game and you'll earn your prize. You'll want to be quick, though, as these codes only last 24 hours.
