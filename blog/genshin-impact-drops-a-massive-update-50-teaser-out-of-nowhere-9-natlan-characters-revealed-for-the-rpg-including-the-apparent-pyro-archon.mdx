Days before the release of update 4.8, Genshin Impact developer HoYoverse dropped a massive preview trailer for Natlan, update 5.0, and the patches to come in the new region, revealing an initial cast of nine seemingly playable characters that also appears to include the Pyro Archon herself. 

The near 4-minute video "Ignition Teaser: A Name Forged in Flames" sets up the next big arc of Genshin Impact's story. The voice actors for all the new characters have helpfully been revealed in tweets which have given us official names to go on, so I'll list them off in the order they appear in the trailer: 

Obviously, we'll only get to play a few of these nine characters in Update 5.0 – likely a mix of one or two premier five-stars, rate-up four-stars, and at least one free four-star, judging from previous updates. We can safely expect the Pyro Archon to debut in update 5.2, as Genshin has taken to releasing Archons in the third patch of each new region. 

Genshin Impact update 5.0 is expected to launch on August 27, six weeks after the start of update 4.8. A full showcase of Natlan should come in the next version preview livestream. We also got [<u>a one-minute look at the tropical region at the end of the 4.8 preview</u>](https://youtu.be/XOK1F9TLEH8).
