Rise of Industry 2 has you putting on your big business pants once again, and the new trailer shown at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) offers another look at how you'll come to dominate the corporate world.

Following up from 2019's Rise of Industry, publisher Kasedo Games is back with a sequel from developer SomaSim, bringing the business management franchise forward several decades to the 1980s and the emerging global economy. And where better to exercise your penchant for profit than the capitalist paradise of the USA, where you'll need to manage your businesses, expand operations, and schmooze with contacts to let your industrious company boom or at least keep it from going bust.

Rise of Industry 2 lets you apply your business expertise to a range of companies in the game's campaign mode, which features 15 different scenarios, each with unique challenges. Whether you want to manufacture cars, mine for natural resources, or sell fine wines, there are many paths to success. However, sandbox mode is there to give you more freedom in how you fill your pockets.

You won't get anywhere without innovating, so building facilities and pouring money into R&D labs to be on the cutting edge is vital. And it's not what you know but who you know, as Rise of Industry 2 has an important social aspect to it where keeping your board happy and networking with fellow CEOs and entrepreneurs from across the world are crucial to staying afloat and reaching the next rungs on the corporate ladder.

Rise of Industry hasn't got an exact release date yet but is targeting a Q2 2025 release for its Steam, Xbox Series X, and PS5 clients. While you wait to get into the C-suite, there's a Steam demo you can circle back on now and you can monitor [Twitter](https://x.com/RiseOfIndustry) for the latest company memos.
