Following speculation surrounding Kratos voice actor Chris Judge seemingly hinting at new [<u>God of War</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/god-of-war/) announcements, he confirms that this isn't what he had intended to do at all - in fact, he's in the dark regarding potential new content just as much as fans are.

Speaking in a recent [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1860887360931569956), Judge addresses the rumors, promptly shutting down hopes of God of War news. "Absolutely not true! You can’t tease something you know nothing about. I will be making announcements in the near future," he confirms, but "I can guarantee none of them will be about OUR beloved God of War. I am awaiting updates just like everyone else." He's planning something, then, it seems - just not what fans expected.

The rumors started after a [livestream](https://x.com/fatimagc2001/status/1860287826392146081) in which the actor dropped cryptic hints about coming "announcements" without specifying what they'd be regarding. "The next two weeks are gonna be chock-full of announcements and all kinds of good stuff," he said at one point, even going on to name a date: "December 1st, we will be making a major announcement - which I can't wait to do 'cause a lot of you asked me: 'What's coming next?'"

While it's admittedly disappointing to hear that these mysterious announcements aren't about [<u>God of War: Ragnarok</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-guide/) or its smash-hit predecessor, there's no telling what Judge could have in store for fans. Perhaps the iconic voice actor is taking on a new project, or as comments are suggesting, something to do with older media like Stargate SG-1 that he's been a part of. Only time will reveal the truth, however, and December, thankfully, isn't all that far off.
