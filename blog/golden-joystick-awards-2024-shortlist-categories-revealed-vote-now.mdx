Have you ever disagreed with Game of the Year lists? Well, now is your chance to help shape them. GamesRadar+ is happy to confirm that voting is live for the 42nd Golden Joystick Awards – where your input will help create conversations around the best video games of the year. 

[Voting is now live in 19 categories,](https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/) including ‘Console Game of the Year,’ ‘PC Game of the Year,’ ‘Best Multiplayer Game,’ and more. If you want to have your say, you've got until Friday, November 1, to make your opinions heard. This year, new categories have been introduced, such as 'Best Soundtrack,' 'Best Audio Design,' and 'Best Indie Game – Self Published,' as we look to celebrate a wider range of releases from 2024. 

There's plenty to get through, but here are some highlights you might find interesting. Astro Bot and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth lead the shortlist with five nominations each, followed by Helldivers 2 with four nominations and Balatro with three nominations. Naturally, [Dragon’s Dogma 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragons-dogma-2-guide/) and [Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-guide/) made the shortlist, as well as scores of other amazing games. 

If you're wondering where 'Ultimate Game of the Year' is, don't worry. That shortlist will go live on Monday, November 4, with voting in that category opening the same day. The winners for all the categories will be revealed in a star-studded award ceremony in central London and live-streamed globally on Thursday, November 21, 2024.
