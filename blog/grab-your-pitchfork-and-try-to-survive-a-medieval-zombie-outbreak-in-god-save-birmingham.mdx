Life during the mid-1300s was already pretty brutal in the UK, with the spectre of the Black Death looming large over Europe and vast swathes of the population being lost to the bubonic plague. However, as exclusively revealed during the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) at Gamescom Presented by Sid Meier’s Civilization® VII, God Save Birmingham envisions another threat to the medieval populace at that time – a zombie outbreak!

Yes, you may have dodged the deadly buboes that signified infection with The Plague, but now there's a potentially greater threat emerging. After waking from a deep sleep, you discover that you're the last survivor and your town is now infested with lumbering zombies, so you'll need to fight you way through the hordes and scavenge enough resources to stay alive.

As the setting is a historically accurate representation of Birmingham, UK during the 1350s, you won't be rigging up any electric fences or emptying rounds from an assault rifle into the crowds of undead, so instead you'll be relying on your trusty pitchfork to fight them off, and avoiding encounters is a safer approach to facing them head-on. You can always piece together a suit of armor to add to your protection, but even that won't keep those bitey peasants off you forever.

Thanks to the realistic physics built into the character mechanics, you can also expect plenty of physical comedy during your survival journey, whether that's kicking a zombie and watching them ragdoll down a flight of stairs, or seeing the undead pratfall over obstacles as they follow you in their single-minded pursuit.

God Save Birmingham doesn't have an official release date confirmed as yet, but it will be initially launching in Steam Early Access and followed up with PlayStation and Xbox versions at full release.
