Hades 2 is landing into Early Access later this year, and the first beta test [has been announced](https://www.gamesradar.com/hades-2-beta-will-begin-shortly-sign-ups-are-already-live-and-the-roguelikes-early-access-shouldnt-be-far-behind/). That's worth celebrating, because as the sequel to one of the [best roguelikes](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-roguelikes-roguelites/) in recent memory, Hades 2 looks set to bowl us over much like its predecessor. The isometric action game also marks the first direct sequel that Supergiant has ever developed, and we can't wait to meet familiar and new faces alike when we return to the God of the Underworld's realm.

This upcoming [new game for 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/) takes place some time after the first Hades, where crown prince Zagreus succeeded in reuniting his parents and meeting all of his Olympian extended family in a dungeon-crawling epic. In Hades 2, he's passing the torch to Melinoë, a cthonic nymph and, according to the mythology, his sister. Supergiant wowed us last year when the Hades 2 reveal trailer gave us a tantalizing taste of what the Princess of Hell will be up to. With 'nary an Olympian God in sight, it seems Melinoë will be setting off on a rescue mission that doubles as an assassination. Her mission? To kill a Titan, who is also her grandpa. Ouch.

Given Supergiant's panache for delivering sprawling, intense storylines packaged up as a punchy roguelike, our excitement for Hades 2 is more than justified. We already have *so *many questions. Will the other Gods be returning to aid Melinoë with boons? Will we see Zagreus at all? And how on earth (or in Hell) did Hades get imprisoned by Chronos? Buzz and speculation aside, though, here's a breakdown of everything there is to know about Hades 2 in the lead up to its launch into Early Access, including how to sign up to be a part of the upcoming playtests.

Our Hades 2 guide was updated on April 17, adding the recent news from Supergiant about the upcoming Hades 2 technical tests that are commencing soon.

Hades 2 will launch into Early Access in Q2 2024, according to developer Supergiant. The sequel will be available simultaneously for Steam and the [Epic Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/epic-games/) Store. [Supergiant has promised](https://www.gamesradar.com/hades-2-early-access-update-offers-a-release-window-for-our-most-anticipated-roguelike/) that the exact date, pricing, and system requirements will be detailed closer to launch. There's no news yet on when the full game will release, but it'll be a good few months after the EA period begins. 



Following in the footsteps of Hades, the sequel is also set to release in Early Access in Q2 2024 for Steam and the Epic Games Store– more information on the early access period is expected to come just ahead of launch. Early Access will give you the chance to purchase and play a work-in-progress version of Hades and have the option to contribute feedback in the lead up to launch. 

[Supergiant says that](https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades-ii-development-update/) "Hades 2 will have at least as much content from day one in Early Access as the original game did back when it launched in Early Access on Steam. And, even though Early Access inherently means a game is not yet complete, we still want to do everything we can to make sure Hades 2 is worth your while as soon as you can play it in any capacity."



If you want sign up for the Hades 2 technical tests, you'll need a Steam account to do so. Supergiant shared details of the upcoming Hades 2 beta via the official [Hades 2 Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/) on April 16, where it announced that all registered users of [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/valve/)'s gaming client are now able to sign up for the playtests by clicking "Request Access" on the Hades 2 storefront. These technical tests are said to be starting "soon", according to the announcement post, and with so many of us no doubt wanting in on the Hades 2 beta, it'd be a lucky thing to be chosen.

"As the purpose of the Technical Test is to test the game with a relatively small audience, we may not be able to honor individual requests to participate," Supergiant warns. "We will do our best to conduct the Technical Test as expeditiously as possible, then launch in Early Access, at which point the game will be available for anyone to purchase and play." Hopefully, this means that an Early Access release date might not be so far off after all.



Hades 2 will introduce us to a new playable character in Melinoë, the immortal princess of the Underworld who we got to meet in the debut reveal trailer. As the sister of Zagreus from the original game, Melinoë is also a character who's plucked from ancient mythology. Said to be based on an ancient Underworld deity, she's thought to be related to Hades in "what little ancient mythology exists about her". With some mystery surrounding the character, Supergiant games said it was eager to "explore her story and connection to her family, in so doing, expand on our vision of the Underworld." 



In terms of the Hades 2 story, the trailer leads me to think that we might be undergoing a reverse version of the first game. In short, that the player will delve down through Hell into Tartarus from a starting point on the surface. This is one of many theories that I'm puzzling over as I wonder [what Hades 2 might look like](https://www.gamesradar.com/hades-2-could-turn-my-favorite-roguelike-upside-down-and-im-trying-to-work-out-what-that-might-look-like/).

Hades 2 is a direct sequel to the original game that is said to take place "sometime" after the events of Zagreus' Underworld escapades. Also set in and around Greek myth, Hades 2 centres around Chronos, the Titan of Time, who's known to be a "wicked father" to Hades and his brothers. Escaped from imprisonment in the Underworld, Chronos now wages war on Olympus. While it is a direct follow-up to the first game, Supergiant makes it clear that you don't need to know anything about Hades or Greek mythology to get stuck into the sequel. 

A Supergiant developer recently confirmed that [it <em>is </em>Hades chained up in the Hades 2 trailer](https://www.gamesradar.com/hades-2-dev-confirms-fan-theory-about-the-reveal-trailer/), suggesting that his daughter will be set out to free her father from his prison and kill Chronos in the process. 



Naturally, Hades 2 is brimming with Greek myth and legend. While you don't need prior knowledge of the broader Hades mythos to enjoy the sequel, Supergiant shares some interesting facts about Witchcraft and its place among Greek myths – including some of the most well known stories out there that inspired Hades and Hades 2. One figure of myth, in particular, is the heart of the sequels direction: 

"Central to this ancient and oft-feared and misunderstood practice is Hecate, the secretive goddess of witchcraft and the crossroads," Supergiant explains over on its [<u>FAQ page</u>](https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades2-faq/) for Hades 2. "She plays a significant role in classical mythology surrounding Hades and the Underworld, and has been an influential and deeply compelling figure in witchcraft, myth, and folklore in a variety of cultures for thousands of years… so much so we felt we needed a whole new game to try and do her justice."

Hades 2 is a rogue-like dungeon crawler, just like the original game, only this time you'll be in a  bigger mythic Underworld that Supergiant reveals will feature new locations, challenges, and upgrade systems to play around with. Melinoë will also have a different arsenal of her own as a witch and sorceress who uses powerful magical abilities and "deadly skill" with "shadowy" weapons. In the debut trailer, we got the chance to see some of her moves in combat as she takes on the forces behind the Titan of Time. And just like Hades, you'll have the powers of Olympus behind you as you navigate the Underworld to imbue your powers.
