Heaven 17 singer Martyn Ware claims that [Rockstar Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/rockstar-games/) only offered $7,500 to use the band's 1983 hit song Temptation in the upcoming [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/) "forever" - a proposition he refused because of GTA 5's outlandish success.

"I was recently contacted by my publishers on behalf of Rockstar Games [about] the possibility of using [the song] Temptation on the new Grand Theft Auto 6," Ware recently [tweeted](https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360363179868488).

"Naturally excited about the immense wealth that was about to head my way, I scrolled to the bottom of the email re the offer…IT WAS $7,500." Ware says the offer wouldn’t net him with any royalty payments, and it gave the studio license to use the song in GTA 6 "forever."

"To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 grossed, wait for it…$8.6 billion," Ware continued. "'Ah, but think of the exposure…' Go f**k yourself."

Rockstar Games' parent company [Take-Two](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/take-two-interactive/) last announced that the blockbuster crimathon had sold over 200 million copies earlier this summer, though we don't actually know if that translates to $8.6 billion. 

Either way, though, GTA 6 is primed to be the biggest thing on Earth next year. One analyst said GTA 6’s importance to the console market ["cannot be overstated,"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-gta-6s-importance-to-the-console-market-cannot-be-overstated-as-sony-and-microsoft-try-to-get-old-gen-players-to-upgrade/) while [Take-Two's CEO himself reckons it could be "unmatched in the industry," ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/ceo-of-rockstar-owner-sizes-up-gta-6-the-worlds-in-a-different-place-than-it-was-when-we-launched-gta-5-and-the-sequel-could-be-unmatched-in-the-industry/)so you’d expect the studio would up its music budget for a game that’ll continue printing money for at least a decade.
