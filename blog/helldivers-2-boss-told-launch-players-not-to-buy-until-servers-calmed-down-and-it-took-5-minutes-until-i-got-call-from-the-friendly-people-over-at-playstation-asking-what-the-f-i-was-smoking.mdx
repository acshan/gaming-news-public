You can partly attribute the success of [Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) to the relationship developer Arrowhead Game Studios has built with fans, who have greatly appreciated creative director and former CEO Johan Pilestedt's straight-talking attitude. But when Pilestedt suggested that cash-strapped players hold off on buying the game until the servers were stable, well, that talk was a little *too* straight for some of the folks at publisher [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) Interactive Entertainment.

Around the time of the Helldivers 2 launch, "the community was super excited about the gameplay that we put up, and everybody flocked in, and it became wildfire," Pilestedt said in a Game Developers Conference panel attended by GamesRadar+. "Everybody told everybody that you need to play this game, and it crushed us under success," he said, referring to the game's [early server issues.](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-dev-doubles-the-player-capacity-of-its-servers-but-tells-fans-its-still-not-enough-to-meet-the-demand/)

"It got to the point where I actually tweeted this," Pilestedt continued, reading out the text of a [February 2024 Twitter post](https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1759750620670505146): "'If you have no cash, get the game later. While we made a really fun game, it's worth waiting until the servers can support capacity. I mean, as CEO, I would, of course, want the game to be as profitable as possible, but if you spent your last dollars and got stuck in server queues I'd be heartbroken.'"

The idea of a [CEO suggesting players <em>not</em> buy their game generated headlines](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-director-says-its-fine-to-play-the-shooter-later-if-you-cant-afford-it-now-its-worth-waiting-until-the-servers-can-support-the-capacity/) at the time, and Pilestedt said it "took 5 minutes until I got a call from the friendly people over at PlayStation asking what the fuck I was smoking. 'Don't recommend that people do not buy your games' - it's incredibly conventional wisdom."
