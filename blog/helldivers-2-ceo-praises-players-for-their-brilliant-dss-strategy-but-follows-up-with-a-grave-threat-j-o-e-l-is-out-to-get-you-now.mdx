Helldivers 2 grunts have figured out how to tame the behemoth Democracy Space Station with a strategy that's so long-overdue, developer Arrowhead's CEO had to threaten them to chill out.

"I just wanna give you folks a big props for the DSS maneuver you did," [<u>Shams Jorjani says</u>](https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1887177229240836598) in Helldivers' Discord. "Brilliant move. J.O.E.L. is out to get you now."

What earned ire from Joel, Helldivers' nefarious Game Master at Arrowhead? The fan account Helldivers_NOW explains players' winning DSS strategy [<u>in a post on Twitter</u>](https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1886791531832750379).

"In the past, the Helldivers community had struggled in fully controlling the Democracy Space Station (DSS) in terms of strategy and its usefulness," Helldivers_NOW says.

But, "as of recent and in a surprise, the Helldivers were able to completely use the DSS to its full potential" by coordinating an assault on Lesath with offensively sending the DSS to Menkent and halting a Jet Brigade in its tracks, [<u>as per a Major Order</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1idotiv/with_the_new_major_order_its_time_to_destroy_that/).

As per *Joel*'s Major Order. Let's remember that J.O.E.L. is the Terminator of third-person shooter co-op, and doesn't like to be bested. That's why he, [<u>or it</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-game-master-joel-seen-for-the-first-time-on-video-and-now-we-have-3-unnerving-truths-he-isnt-human-has-psychic-powers-and-his-name-is-an-acronym/), often pushes even the most idealistic Helldivers soldiers to commit unspeakable acts in the name of his neverending war.

Like in November, when Helldivers introduced the so-called "weapon of mass liberation" DSS, Joel directed Helldivers to [<u>exploit "disenfranchised families" as "cheap labor"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2s-joel-gives-cruelest-major-order-yet-as-high-command-eyes-disenfranchised-families-as-cheap-labor-to-work-on-the-dangerously-sketchy-new-superweapon/) to finish its construction. Does his cruelty know no bounds?

Now, he's definitely quaking in his evil boots about the fact that Helldivers 2 grunts are using his superweapon to their own advantage. Deal with it, J.O.E.L.
