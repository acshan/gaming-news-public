The [Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) devs have spent the week or so promoting a major patch aimed at addressing a whole pile of player concerns, but one developer is offering a reminder that this one's about evolution rather than revolution.

On Discord, community manager Thomas 'Twinbeard' Petersson was asked how he'd rate the new patch on a scale of 1-10. "I'd rate the patch a strong 7 or an 8 (or a 3+ to -4 if you prefer)," Twinbeard says. As for why it's not a 10/10, he adds that "I'm picky in terms of grading and review scores. If everything's great, what do you say when something comes along that IS truly great? So yeah. A solid patch with a bunch of changes; evolutionary rather than revolutionary."

Twinbeard has said similar things in the recent past, noting that the [upcoming update won't be the "biggest patch of all time."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/the-first-update-of-helldivers-2s-60-day-rescue-plan-wont-be-the-biggest-patch-of-all-time-but-it-will-push-the-game-in-the-right-direction/) A proper 9 or 10/10 patch, in Twinbeard's estimation, would take "new substantial game mechanics or systems being implemented that also improved the game as a whole." Stuff like new areas, vehicles, enemies, weapons, and the like.

What this upcoming patch will feature is a *whole* lot of buffs. The [Railgun's power is getting quadrupled](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-devs-werent-kidding-about-huge-buffs-coming-this-month-the-railgun-is-about-to-utterly-destroy-large-enemies-we-kind-of-quadrupled-that/), the [controversial Flamethrower changes are getting rolled back alongside a 33% damage buff](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-devs-are-rolling-back-some-of-escalation-of-freedoms-controversial-flamethrower-changes-and-buffing-damage-by-33-putting-bug-barbequing-back-on-the-menu/), and the [Breaker is getting buffed back to what it was at launch](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2s-most-popular-shotgun-is-finally-getting-a-buff-reverting-the-breaker-to-what-it-was-at-launch/). Exactly how all these buffs work together in practice remains to be seen, but even if this patch isn't "revolutionary," in Twinbeards words, it seems the community is anticipating a big step in the right direction.
