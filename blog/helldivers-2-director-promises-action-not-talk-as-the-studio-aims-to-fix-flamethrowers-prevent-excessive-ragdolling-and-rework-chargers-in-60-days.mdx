After a very mixed reception to the latest [Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) update, the game's director is tackling the feedback with a 60-day plan to make things right, alongside a list of longer-term changes the studio intends to make in how it communicates with players.

"I want to directly address the feedback you've raised about the [Escalation of Freedom update](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update/)," game director Mikael E says in a message shared to players on social media, including [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1erc9w5/the_message_to_the_community_from_our_game/). "We’ve spent the last week listening to feedback, reflecting about the path ahead for Helldivers 2 and how we want to continue developing the game. In short, we didn’t hit our target with the latest update. Some things we just didn’t get right - and other more fundamental inconsistencies in our approach to game balance and game direction. All of that is on us and we are going to own that.  As many of you have pointed out, and we agree, what matters most now is action. Not talk."

In terms of action, Mikael E says "our aim within the next 60 days" is to do the following: 

Balance has been a particularly hot topic since Escalation of Freedom dropped with a [big change to flamethrowers that effectively nerfed them just before a flame-themed Warbond](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-players-in-shambles-as-flamethrowers-get-nerfed-just-in-time-for-the-flamethrower-themed-warbond-not-one-single-person-is-happy-about-this-change/), making the weapon far less effective against the infamous Chargers. Community ire drew comments from Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, who [admitted that those nerfs are "disappointing after we had a similar misstep earlier."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/ill-own-this-screwup-helldivers-2-studio-ceo-apologizes-for-balance-comments-admits-fire-weapon-nerfs-are-disappointing-after-we-had-a-similar-misstep-earlier/)

In today's post, Mikael E also notes that the team is "exploring creation of an opt-in beta-test environment to improve our testing processes and we consider this a high-priority." Earlier this month, Arrowhead noted that a [test server is "on the wishlist."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-says-a-helldivers-2-test-server-is-on-the-wishlist/) The devs also intend to conduct more player surveys, offer more detailed patch notes with explanations for changes, and provide the community with larger blog posts going into even greater depth.
