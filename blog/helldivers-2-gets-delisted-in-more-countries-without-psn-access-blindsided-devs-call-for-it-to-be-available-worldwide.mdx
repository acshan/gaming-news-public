[Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) is still being removed from sale on Steam in more countries, even after publisher [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) Interactive Entertainment (SIE) scrapped its hugely controversial [PSN](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/playstation-network/) mandate. 

SIE previously attempted to [force Helldivers 2 PC players to link to an active PlayStation Network account](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-to-a-psn-account-later-this-month-for-greater-security-from-sony/) months after launch, leading to a mass review-bombing campaign and [Steam delistment in over 170 countries without PSN coverage](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-steam-in-170-countries-without-psn-access-while-valve-ignores-its-own-policy-to-issue-refunds-for-players-with-over-100-hours/). Sony eventually scrapped the mandate, keeping account linking as a simple option, but the year's biggest shooter is still being restricted in more countries. 

Helldivers 2 has now been pulled from Steam in three other countries lacking PSN coverage - Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania - according to listings on [Steam Database](https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/). It's unclear if existing Helldivers 2 owners in those countries can still play the game.

The news seems to have come as a surprise to even the game's own developers at Arrowhead Studios. "We have no idea what's going on," CEO Johan Pilestedt said in response to a player on the game's Discord channel. "Most devs are on a bank holiday and we just found out through the community. We want the game to be available worldwide."

Helldivers 2 has also not been returned to the 170 or so territories that were locked out of purchasing the game, which was a major reason why players banded together to negatively review the game in the first place. But Pilestedt assured players that he was [working with PlayStation and Valve to get Helldivers 2 back on the storefront "everywhere."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-director-still-talking-to-playstation-and-valve-about-relisting-the-shooter-everywhere-after-psn-mandate-saw-the-game-pulled-in-over-170-countries/)
