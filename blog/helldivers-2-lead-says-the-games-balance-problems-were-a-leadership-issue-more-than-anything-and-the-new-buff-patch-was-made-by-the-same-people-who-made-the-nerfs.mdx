[Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) game director and Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt says a lack of cohesion and leadership issues are to blame for the backlash from the community following the controversial [Escalation of Freedom](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-update/) update. For that reason, the devs behind the recent buff patch are the same devs who worked on the nerfs that are now being fixed.

Although [the first big patch of Arrowhead's 60-day comeback strategy has been a major hit with freedom fighters](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/as-the-first-big-helldivers-2-patch-of-arrowheads-60-day-plan-wins-back-divers-the-shooters-creative-director-agrees-that-nerfing-is-an-unimaginative-way-of-tweaking-a-game/), [Pilestedt recently took to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1fjw4bo/comment/lnu8w01/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to engage directly with that ever-vocal corner of the Helldivers community. In response to a player who thought Pilestedt was trying to "shift the blame on the dev team as if you weren't the person in charge," Pilestedt had this to say:

"Hey, thank you for the feedback. Not my intention to do so! There are plenty of talented developers at the studio that have a desire and ability to make the game as good as possible for the community."

Pilestedt went further to place the majority of the blame on a lack of cohesion stemming from a "leadership issue," which of course would fall mostly on him considering he's the head of the studio.

"For instance this last patch, when it came to bringing the balance into a good place, we had the same people on it as before and they worked together to deliver a good update, but in times when we have had weak direction the cohesion falters and we misstep," Pilestedt said.

[Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/)'s first [grand onslaught of buffs](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/first-major-patch-of-helldivers-2s-60-day-plan-is-a-huge-list-of-changes-designed-to-do-two-things-keep-divers-alive-for-longer-and-kill-bots-and-bugs-much-quicker/) to make the game fun again is here, forming just part of developer Arrowhead's [60-day plan](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-devs-outline-the-first-patch-of-their-60-day-action-plan-committing-to-sweeping-armor-overhauls-and-major-nerfs-to-both-bugs-and-bots/) to return to the third-person shooter to surer footing.

The aforementioned [60-day plan](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-director-promises-action-not-talk-as-the-studio-aims-to-fix-flamethrowers-prevent-excessive-ragdolling-and-rework-chargers-in-60-days/) to win back divers started with [a modest update simply intended to get the ball rolling](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/the-first-update-of-helldivers-2s-60-day-rescue-plan-wont-be-the-biggest-patch-of-all-time-but-it-will-push-the-game-in-the-right-direction/). Pilestedt laid out a list of plans to address some of the loudest feedback from the Escalation of Freedom update, and those include a restructured approach to balance, updates to fire damage, updates to address excessive ragdolling, and more.
