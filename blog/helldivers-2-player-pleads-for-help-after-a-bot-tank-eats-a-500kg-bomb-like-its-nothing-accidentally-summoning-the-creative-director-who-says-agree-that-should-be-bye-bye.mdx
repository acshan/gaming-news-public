A Helldivers 2 player recently discovered the agonizing truth that some bot tanks in the co-op third person shooter are bulletproof. Or, more accurately, 500kg bomb-proof.

In a recent [<u>Reddit post</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1fsa4tr/ah_please_fix_this_enemy_tank_how_tf_can_it/), the user SLAYA_27 begged devs for relief after their attempt to decimate an enemy tank resulted in an earth-shaking explosion and their untimely, bloody elimination. 

"Please fix this enemy tank," they wrote on Reddit. "How tf can it survive a 500kg in its turret!!" 

In the corresponding gameplay video, SLAYA_27 deploys the massive Eagle 500kg Bomb stratagem, a hefty explosive best suited to hurting close-range enemies. Some Helldivers 2 fans find that fact disappointing — "500kg is incredibly strong, vaporizes anything within 1m of the blast zone," says one popular [<u>Reddit comment</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1bx8wsz/comment/kyb2kzx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). "Sadly, even though the explosion itself is huge, outside of that 1m it's a wet fart." 

Tragically, wet farts are not compatible with Helldivers 2's new tanks, which are wildly strong. After SLAYA_27 drops their 500kg Bomb, it bursts in a beam of inescapable orange light and… nothing happens. The tank is unscathed, and SLAYA_27's character becomes a droopy ragdoll in the explosion. But they aren't alone in the experience. In another [<u>Reddit thread</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eq5sa1/the_new_bot_tanks_are_bugged_into_being_op/), a fan complains that tanks are "bugged into being OP." 

"It blew me and my friend into smithereens with a burst barrage," they said. "It could AT LEAST have had the decency to blow itself up, but I guess that privilege is only for our mech." 

At least Helldivers 2 devs seem to recognize that their tanks' excessive tankiness is a problem. After a commenter on SLAYA_27's post mused on how "a piece of thermite can burn through [a tank], but half a ton of liberty does nothing," creative director Johan Pilestedt replied "Agree, that should be bye-bye." For players' safety, hopefully tanks' strange imperviousness does go bye-bye soon.
