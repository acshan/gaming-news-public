With less than two hours to go, [Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) players are resigning themselves to the fact that they've failed the Major Order.

Helldivers 2 players have spent the best part of a few months repeatedly dodging the Anti-Tank Mines in just about every conceivable way, [including voluntarily rescuing kids over the Stratagem](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/new-helldivers-2-major-order-gives-players-another-shot-at-securing-anti-tank-mines-but-only-if-they-pick-the-stratagem-over-saving-thousands-of-super-earth-children/). The current Major Order, however, [threatens Helldivers 2 players with immediately unlocking the mines](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-is-now-straight-up-threatening-players-with-a-new-stratagem-theyve-avoided-for-months-kill-15-billion-enemies-asap-or-you-get-the-mines/) unless they vanquish 1.5 billion enemies around the galaxy.

At the time of writing, it's looking like Helldivers 2 players are set to fail the current Major Order, which will summarily unlock the mines for them. The Reddit post below was from yesterday, August 5, when Helldivers 2 players were at just 51% completion percentage on the Major Order with less than 18 hours to go. Fast forward to today, and the completion percentage has risen to 64% with under two hours to go.

So yes, it's looking like the Anti-Tank Mines might finally be unlocked in Helldivers 2 in just a few hours from now. "If these mines turn out to be garbage I'm gonna be very sad," [writes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ekx5pi/comment/lgobth1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) one Reddit commenter, to which another astutely [responds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ekx5pi/comment/lgocoq0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): "They're mines, we already know they're garbage." No one wants these damn mines, but it looks like they're getting them anyway.

One common line of reasoning is that Helldivers 2 players are frustrated by the fact that regular in-game minefields, commonly found surrounding Automaton bases, can chain-detonate if one mine is set off. If the same thing applies to player-deployed mines, that could just be another reason for players to hate the mines all the more.
