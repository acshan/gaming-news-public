Uh oh. Following their Major Order victory earlier today, [<u>Helldivers 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) players have been thrown straight back into the fray with new orders to defend Matar Bay from the Automatons, but with a twist. They're led by a new "augmented" group that can fly. 

While things are now quieter on the eastern front of the galaxy, with the protection around Acamar IV ultimately "allowing the successful construction of the first-ever Terminid Research Preserve," things are stirring elsewhere. In a worrisome post shared on Twitter, Helldivers are told: "While the eastern front now has calmed, the socialist toasters on the western front has unleashed a new fighting force. Automaton warships have appeared in massive numbers in the atmosphere of Matar Bay. Multiple SEAF bases have already fallen."

Super Earth says that "an augmented Automaton detachment" is leading the invasion. Some shaky footage from the scene shows this augmentation in action – the so-called "socialist toasters" clearly "stole jetpack tech," it's said. In a way, we can't blame them – the Jump Pack was recently buffed in [<u>Arrowhead's big 63-day action plan patch</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2s-massive-63-day-overhaul-patch-is-here-bringing-an-end-to-a-rebalance-of-over-70-weapons-and-stratagems-while-also-making-certain-terminids-explode-for-some-reason/), and now boasts a reduced cooldown, a stronger thrust force, and a "slightly higher jump and more forward momentum." As players quickly clocked, it flies *a lot* farther now. Clearly, the bots wanted in on those changes, too.

Terrifying scenes from the front line are already emerging on Reddit, and early calculations suggest that [<u>a lot of players are going to have to chip in</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1g6i2e8/ummm_excuse_me_a_level_40_and_requiring_55k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) if Super Earth's finest have any hope of emerging victorious. At the very least, the Helldivers have just short of five full days to pull it off, and the weekend should help give the efforts a boost.
