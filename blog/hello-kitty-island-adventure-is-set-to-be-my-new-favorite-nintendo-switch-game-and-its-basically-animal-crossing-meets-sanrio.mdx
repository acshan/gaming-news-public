The recent [Nintendo Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/nintendo-direct-june-2024-live-coverage-everything-announced/) has blessed us with many an exciting reveal, including news of Hello Kitty Island Adventure's release next year on the Switch.

Hello Kitty Island Adventure first debuted on iOS last summer, leaving cozy game fans wondering whether the adorable title would ever launch on non-mobile platforms. During today's big [Nintendo Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/nintendo-direct/) showcase, developer Sunblink unveiled that the whimsical Animal Crossing-esque game is indeed on its way to the Nintendo Switch - and it'll drop on the portable console in 2025.

The wholesome adventure sees some of Sanrio's most beloved faces come to life including Cinnamoroll, Hello Kitty, and Kuromi. Alongside this cute crew, players work to restore an abandoned island - much like in [New Horizons](https://www.gamesradar.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-guide/). There's crafting, decorating, exploring, shopping, and puzzles to solve galore in Hello Kitty Island Adventure, making it the perfect go-to game for us Animal Crossing aficionados.

Island Adventure is also frequently updated, with the most recent prominent patch, dubbed [Cabins & Castles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZ-aCpRV9k&ab_channel=Sunblink), introducing various cabin customization options, precious island visitors, quests, and more. Fans of timed events will be happy to hear that the game features many - meaning unique revolving rewards and themed goodies for hardened collectors.

As I wait for [Nintendo](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/nintendo/) to announce (literally any) news about New Horizons or its potential future successors, [games like Animal Crossing](https://www.gamesradar.com/games-like-animal-crossing/) keep me afloat and Hello Kitty Island Adventure seems to tick all of my boxes. Plus, it involves Cinnamoroll *and* Little Twin Stars - what more could I ask for as a Sanrio stan?
