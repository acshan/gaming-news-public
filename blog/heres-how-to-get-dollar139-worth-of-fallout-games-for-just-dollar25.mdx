Fallout Bundle | [$139.95<u><strong> $24.99 at Fanatical</strong></u>](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8150600-13589267?sid=grd-gb-1293023052342935573&url=https://www.fanatical.com/bundle/fallout-bundle)
*Save $114.96 - *This is a fantastic offer for newcomers to the series (or anyone looking to return to the wasteland on PC). You’re getting the full Steam collection for just $24.99 - a massive $114.96 discount of 82%. 

Buy it if: 

✅ You’ve been tempted by the show
✅ You enjoy open-world RPGs
✅ You want the full Fallout timeline

Don't buy it if: 

❌ You’re only interested in Fallout 4
❌ You don’t want to play on Steam



There’s undeniable value in that $24.99 bundle price, considering the sheer amount of gameplay hours you’re getting across seven major titles. If you’re already a Fallout fan and you’re simply looking to get all the games on PC, it’s a no-brainer (rumors around an upcoming Fallout 3 remake might be the only thing to stop you). However, those new to the series stand to get the best deal here. 

Thankfully, Fallout is a pretty easy game to love. If you’re into open-world action RPGs you’ll be set with everything from Fallout 3 onwards. If you can get past the older graphics and more linear progression the earlier games provide a nostalgic feel but still hold up tremendously in their gameplay. No, the games aren’t like the series - that’s more of a separate storyline set within the same universe. However, if you’re a fan of making your own way through a story you’re going to enjoy the later releases in this franchise.
