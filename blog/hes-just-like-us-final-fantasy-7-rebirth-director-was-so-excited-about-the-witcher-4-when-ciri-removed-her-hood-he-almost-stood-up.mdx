Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi hasn't exactly been shy about his love for The Witcher, so he reacted just like the rest of us when [CD Projekt Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/)'s new saga was properly shown off at [The Game Awards 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/game-awards-2024-everything-announced/).

Hamaguchi hasn't been tight-lipped about CDPR's fantasy series. Just last week, the director said [The Witcher 3 was one of his biggest inspirations](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-had-to-swap-his-inspirations-from-the-last-of-us-to-the-witcher-3-to-make-rebirths-open-world/) while making an open-world pivot in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth because why not look to the genre's best? But he didn't just play The Wild Hunt for work and research purposes, though.

In a new Reddit AMA with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's leads, Hamaguchi cited the threequel as his favorite game of all time. Series producer Yoshinori Kitase then [wrote about](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1hdqppe/comment/m1yt933/) how the duo were in the crowd at The Game Awards this year when [The Witcher 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-guide/)'s first trailer debuted. "Hamaguchi was so excited when Ciri removed her hood, he almost stood up!" All I can say is: same, same. 

The Witcher stans, Hamaguchi included, should be more than happy to learn that [Geralt will in fact be part of The Witcher 4 as CDPR recently revealed that, yes, that was Doug Cockle's iconic husky voice at the end of the trailer](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/geralt-will-return-in-the-witcher-4-confirms-cd-projekt-red-and-yes-thats-his-voice-you-hear-at-the-end-of-the-rpgs-new-trailer/). But we'll need to wait until the game eventually drops to learn [why Ciri needed to be the protagonist](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/how-did-ciri-end-up-the-star-of-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-head-says-well-theres-the-story-of-the-witcher-4-to-tell-that-tale/) since it's apparently closely tied to what's happening in the story.

Elsewhere, [Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth's PC port was announced to be coming next month](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/pc-gamers-really-ate-at-the-game-awards-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-pc-release-date-finally-set-for-next-month/). The game itself was up for multiple trophies at the show - including the main Game of the Year award - but only walked away with a prize for Best Soundtrack and, like, who could argue against that?
