A Tango Gameworks developer has reacted to an Xbox executive reportedly asking for more "smaller games that give us prestige and awards" with a picture of Hi-Fi Rush's awards.

In the wake of [Microsoft shutting down four Bethesda-owned studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/microsoft-reportedly-closing-the-bethesda-studios-behind-redfall-hi-fi-rush-and-more-following-reprioritization-of-titles-and-resources/) earlier this week, including the Tokyo-based Tango Gameworks, one [Xbox executive reportedly asked for "smaller games that give us prestige and awards"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hi-fi-rush-lead-reacts-to-xbox-exec-asking-for-smaller-games-that-give-us-prestige-and-awards-right-after-closing-studio-that-made-prestigious-award-winning-smaller-game/) in an internal meeting. Hi-Fi Rush's director reacted to the news with something akin to a massive eyeroll, and now another Tango Gameworks developer has responded.

Posting on his personal Twitter account, former Tango Gameworks project manager Kazuaki Egashira tweeted out images of the awards Hi-Fi Rush had won over the past year from around the gaming industry, with the caption "not enough?" Egashira's message is a direct response to the Xbox executive requesting more award-winning games.

Hi-Fi Rush won a total of five developer awards over the course of 2023. The awards include one for animation from BAFTA Games, audio/sound awards from the CEDEC, Game Awards, and Game Developer's Choice awards, and the Tin Pan Alley Award for Best Music in a Game from the New York Game Awards. That's to say nothing of outlet-granted awards.

[Hi-Fi Rush players have been mourning the game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hi-fi-rush-fans-mourn-studio-closure-despite-critical-acclaim-and-millions-of-players-what-hope-is-there-for-anyone/), and the studio that made it, over the past week, wondering how anyone could possibly be safe from cuts from corporations that were able to shutter an award-winning and beloved studio. Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami, who founded Tango Gameworks and departed the studio just last year, [called the move "sad."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-calls-microsofts-decision-to-shut-down-the-studio-he-helped-found-sad/)
