I sure wasn't expecting [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/) to just casually drop some new [Death Stranding 2: On the Beach](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-2-guide/) footage on [Twitter](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1887839254375731452) here on a random Friday, but he's gone and done exactly that. It looks like the new trailer we've all been waiting for is inching ever closer.

This is an extended version of a scene we previously saw in the [State of Play trailer](https://youtu.be/wbLstJHlC4U?si=bYP1602cHqLZH1m4&t=143) last January, where Sam and Fragile are discussing a mysterious benefactor who Sam doesn't trust. "We've both been used and lied to before, it's true," Fragile responds in this extended cut. "But as long as they keep up their end, I won't pry."

I've seen some discussion from fans that Fragile's face model might be improved from its previous presentation throughout the clip, more closely matching actor LÃ©a Seydoux's actual appearance, but it's a bit tough to tell in this grainy, off-screen presentation.

Kojima notes that this is part of "main sound mixing with London," which seems to effectively confirm previous speculation that [he's been teasing a new Death Stranding 2 trailer on social media](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/as-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-rated-in-south-korea-and-hideo-kojima-appears-to-tease-a-new-trailer-a-release-date-seems-more-likely-than-ever/) over the past few days. There have been various rumblings about a new [PlayStation State of Play](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/playstation-state-of-play/) event in the near future, and that'd certainly be a solid place to debut the next look at Death Stranding 2.

The previous Death Stranding 2 trailer noted that the game was set to launch in 2025. Here's hoping the next trailer reconfirms that window and narrows it down just a little.
