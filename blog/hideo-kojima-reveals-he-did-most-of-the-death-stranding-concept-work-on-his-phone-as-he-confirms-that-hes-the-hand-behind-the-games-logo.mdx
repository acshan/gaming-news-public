Some of Death Stranding's earliest ideas came together on [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/)'s phone.

Over the weekend, Kojima took to [Twitter](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1855894926585671945) to reminisce about his studio and, by extension, Death Stranding's humble beginnings on the game's 5th anniversary. At first, Kojima Productions was only a studio in name, as the Metal Gear creator's office space was more of a closet that could barely fit a handful of desks. "Since it was so tiny, I was the only one coming in," Kojima says.

Kojima goes on to say that all he had around that time was a computer, a PS4 to watch Blu-rays, headphones, a smartphone, and a few other bits and pieces. As such, most of Death Stranding's concepts were done on Kojima's phone – in between scrolling Twitter and [posting film takes](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-movies/hideo-kojima-gives-his-verdict-on-joker-folie-a-deux-and-its-much-more-positive-than-his-venom-or-madame-web-reviews/), surely.

That's not the only tidbit Kojima has [revealed](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1855893848670544213), either. If you remember the hand that forms part of Death Stranding's logo, that belongs to none other than Kojima himself. Quite a hands-on approach, then.

Now that Kojima's got some new tech to hand, we don't have long to wait to play the next Death Stranding game. We know [Death Stranding 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-2-guide/) is due to release in 2025, and Kojima says the very date has already been decided – though he couldn't reveal it at the Tokyo Game Show due to "unforeseen reasons." Here's hoping we're not waiting too long for a solid date.

*Speaking of teasers, *[<em>Hideo Kojima showed nine seconds of Death Stranding 2 title screen footage and warned that it's "very much temporary."</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-shows-9-seconds-of-death-stranding-2-title-screen-footage-and-warns-that-its-very-much-temporary/)
