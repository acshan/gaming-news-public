Face of stealth games and [<u>lover of movies</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hideo-kojima-all-of-us-strangers/) [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/) recently reminisced about his vampire hunting series Boktai for the 21st anniversary of its first installment on Game Boy Advance. Apparently, the game's solar-powered weapon was a tough sell for Kojima's development team, and it probably didn't help that it was raining on release day. 

"I remember that it was raining hard," Kojima [<u>wrote on X (Twitter)</u>](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1813355413666218048). 

Boktai uses a solar sensor on its cartridge to measure actual sunlight, which players would use to more efficiently charge the protagonist's unique, monster-shattering Gun del Sol and solve puzzles. "The gameplay changes depending on where you live, where you play and when you play," Kojima said in [<u>another post</u>](https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1813356200979042653). "This game was even more difficult to explain internally and also externally than Metal Gear (about [<u>the concept of stealth</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/37-years-later-hideo-kojima-says-metal-gear-was-so-ahead-of-its-time-because-of-its-portable-radio-not-its-stealth-action/))." 

Even after 21 years, Boktai's game mechanics feel eccentric and inventive. Long after Boktai released, players would marvel at how difficult it was to play it [<u>without real sunlight</u>](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/920413-boktai-2-solar-boy-django/55470805#:~:text=But%20yeah%2C%20the%20game%20is,of%20sun%20until%20sunset%2Fmorning.), and modern emulators [<u>patched the sun mechanic out</u>](https://github.com/Prof9/Boktai-Solar-Sensor-Patches) altogether, standardizing its gameplay. No wonder it was difficult for Kojima to explain the game's concept to people — some players continue to have a hard time accepting it. 

"Just go outside, a little fresh air won't kill you," one Boktai fan advises another player in a 14-year-old GameFAQs thread that fills me with nostalgia. Boktai was a golden opportunity to touch grass and we wasted it. 

[Kojima's OD](https://www.gamesradar.com/od-overdose-hideo-kojima-xbox-guide/) is poised to be similarly interactive, albeit seemingly with less sunlight involved. In January, Kojima reiterated on X that Boktai "was met with fierce opposition from the staff and even within the company," and that, "in that sense, 'OD' is just as different." Without a release window for OD, we'll have to wait to see how true that is.
