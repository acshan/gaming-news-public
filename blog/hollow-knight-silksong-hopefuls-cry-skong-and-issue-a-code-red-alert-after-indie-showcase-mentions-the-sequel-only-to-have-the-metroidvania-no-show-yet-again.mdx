Hollow Knight fans parched for more Silksong news are no strangers to disappointment when it comes to the big trailerthon showcases, but this week's Triple-I Initiative stung extra hard.

The Triple-I Initiative was an event organized by some of the biggest names in the indie scene, with the developers behind [Slay the Spire](https://www.gamesradar.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-the-roguelike-card-game-that-spawned-countless-deck-builders-gets-a-gorgeous-and-expanded-sequel-in-2025-with-new-class-necrobinder/), Dead Cells, and more coming together to debut dozens of trailers from independent teams. [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-silksong-guide/) hopefuls already had one eyebrow raised before the show, but they went into a frenzy when the pre-stream countdown teased the sequel.

"What's the name of this highly anticipated Metroidvania with an insect again?" one cheeky, loading screen-style message joked in the stream's countdown timer. In fairness, the countdown broadcast several similar, quippy, unserious messages, such as: "thuis lpoadfing tilp was grenerrted byy AI."

Of course, that didn't stop fans from going into overdrive. One Reddit post officially declared a "Code Red" as the community raised its hopes once more for the first Hollow Knight: Silksong trailer in almost two years. Defeated memes about clown makeup ensued, as expected. But the community went one step further this time, with countless Twitter accounts [spamming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1c1dfu0/no_harassment_no_threats_just_s_k_o_n_g_lets_keep/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the word "SKONG" underneath posts from Triple-I.

This isn't the first time that a Silksong tease went nowhere, though. [The Game Awards 2023 raised expectations](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-got-their-hopes-up-at-the-mention-of-something-from-a-small-indie-team-from-australia-only-to-be-immediately-disappointed/) with a mention of a "small team from Australia," only to dash those hopes immediately. Silksong snoopers are so used to disappointment that [preparing clown makeup has become a community in-joke](https://www.gamesradar.com/defeated-hollow-knight-silksong-fans-are-keeping-expectations-in-check-for-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-i-have-run-out-of-clown-makeup-long-ago/) before any industry event.

Things seem to be looking up for the subterranean sequel, however, since [an Xbox store page for Silksong recently went live on April Fools Day](https://www.gamesradar.com/chaos-reigns-as-new-hollow-knight-silksong-store-page-found-on-april-1-of-all-days-xbox-marketing-exec-says-its-not-a-joke/), no less. Xbox marketing manager Tao Sila even confirmed that the new listing was no joke. A sign of things to come? Or business as usual?
