> The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) has released a surprisingly catchy music video and song called 'E is For Everyone' to celebrate its 30th anniversary, highlighting its role in rating games and protecting user data.

Last week, I got an odd press release. That's not altogether unusual - I'm still deleting pitches for coverage of NFT games to this very day - but this was a rare one with a bizarre hook: "ESRB Celebrates 30 Years with E is for Everyone Music Video & Single Release." The idea of the Entertainment Software Ratings Board of all things releasing a *music video and single* was so utterly mesmerizing that I had to know more.

When I first clicked through on the video, it had barely reached three-digit views - and even now it's only just above 1,000 views, most of which have to be from me. It is, indeed, a music video for an ESRB song called E is For Everyone. I was immediately gobsmacked. I dropped everything to let the majesty of this thing wash over me.

E is For Everyone has the vibes of a Schoolhouse Rock song and while it's no Conjunction Junction, it's bizarrely catchy. The magical part for me is just how *deeply* uncool it all is. You can tell the lyrics had to go through a few too many revisions to make sure it all fit the ESRB's branding and messaging standards, and it's all just delightfully awkward. How often do you get a song telling you all about the function of the Advertising Review Council? Not enough, clearly. 

"With the help of some of ESRB’s musically gifted staff and composer Alex Engelberg," ESRB president Patricia Vance says in the press release, "this celebratory song helps illustrate the important public service and self-regulatory role that ESRB has performed for the past three decades on behalf of the video game industry."

If the [music video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGIj5eXRxC4) isn't enough for you, you can also listen to E is For Everyone on Apple Music and Spotify. Because I am obsessed with this whole thing, I have also transcribed the song's full lyrics for you below. Enjoy.
