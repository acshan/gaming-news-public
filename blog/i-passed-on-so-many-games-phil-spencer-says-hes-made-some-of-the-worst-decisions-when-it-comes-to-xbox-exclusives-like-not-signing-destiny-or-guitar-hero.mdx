Both [<u>Destiny</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/destiny/) and Guitar Hero could've ended up as [<u>Xbox</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/xbox/) exclusives - if [<u>Microsoft</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) Gaming lead [Phil Spencer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/phil-spencer/) hadn't "passed" on signing the now iconic titles.

Speaking at a PAX West [panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsvw-WPBfU&t=2845s), Spencer reveals that Xbox considered signing [Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bungie/)'s beloved sci-fi shooter but ultimately chose not to: "Getting the pitch for Destiny on 'do we want to sign this' - we ended up not signing Destiny. It obviously went with [Activision](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/activision/), and to see what it grew into, like from a business kind of Xbox standpoint, I can look at it … and it's just a really interesting journey in terms of what [[Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bungie/)] built."

After briefly comparing Destiny to [<u>Halo</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/halo/), fellow Bungie banger and arguably one of the most successful Xbox exclusives ever, Spencer explains that the online shooter initially "didn't really click" with him as he's not a "big PvP player." His mind gradually changed as the game's second expansion dropped, though: "It turns out that's not what it was at all like, and when [House of] Wolves came out, it definitely landed me."

Despite his eventual love for Destiny, Spencer doesn't dwell on the decision to not sign the game - after all, it's one of many: "I've passed on some of the worst, like made some of the worst game choice decisions." Another such game that got away was Guitar Hero, a title that Spencer says he felt at first wasn't "going to work" for Xbox. The concept was too surreal, from the toy-esque instrument plugged directly into a console to the gameplay itself.

"[Alex Rigopulos] pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars and they're going to plug into consoles and then they're going to sell tracks … "I'm like, 'really, do we really think that's going to work?'" The strange formula did indeed end up working. "A few people played Guitar Hero," Spencer jokes. "I hear that was turned into a pretty good game." He still doesn't regret not signing, though.

"I'm not a regrets type person. Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games." Instead of looking back with frustration, Spencer tries to "look forward and be positive about the things we are doing." With smash-hit games like Destiny, that means celebrating studios such as Bungie and their monumental work: "I just like to celebrate what the team has done. I mean, it's incredible."
