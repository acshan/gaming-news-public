Prime Day is now in full swing, and I'm honestly surprised by how good some of the deals on board games have been. Actually, this is probably the most appealing clutch of discounts I've seen for the sale in a long while - and I've been covering it for *years *now.¬†

Naturally, there's a lot of tat floating around as well. But for the most part, this year's [Prime Day board game deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/prime-day-board-game-deals/) are on the money. Or off it, I suppose, considering all those discounts. Anyway, we're getting off track. As the GamesRadar+ Tabletop & Merch Editor, I spend a lot of time thinking and writing about board games - so I've rounded up the offers I'm actually considering myself.

Seeing as more than a few could justifiably appear on our list of the [best board games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-board-games/), I'd say they should at least be on your radar. Just be aware that you'll need a Prime account to take advantage of them, and the sale will end by midnight on October 9!

Mysterium | [$54.99 $28.36 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FAsmodee-MYST01-Mysterium%2Fdp%2FB013TJ5P80%2F%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-4434579762324839020-20)
*Save $26 - *I'm always a hair's breadth away from clicking 'buy now' for this spooky co-op board game, mainly because it's excellent and I'm a sucker for Halloween-adjacent things. 2024 may be my chance as it's not been cheaper in roughly a year. It rarely goes much beyond $35 either.

Buy it if:
‚úÖ You love a spooky game
‚úÖ You want a good co-op game

Don't buy it if:
‚ùå Communication isn't your strong suite

*Save $45 - *Top of my hit-list is this very well-received co-op game that always gets praise heaped on it. Classic Spirit Island is now a single dollar away from its lowest ever price, and it usually hangs around $66. 

Buy it if:
‚úÖ You want a deep strategy game
‚úÖ You prefer working as a team

Don't buy it if:
‚ùå You'd rather fly solo

*Save $20 - *I've got loads of time for this monster-themed push-your-luck game, but it's still not on my shelf for reasons quite beyond me. Seeing as it hasn't been cheaper since 2023, now's my chance.

Buy it if:
‚úÖ You'd like a family-friendly game

Don't buy it if:
