Not only is Mika and the Witch's Mountain an adorable Kiki's Delivery Service-style gem, but it also appears to be directly inspired by one of the [best <u>Zelda</u> games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-zelda-games/) - Wind Waker.

Mika and the Witch's Mountain is one of my most highly anticipated games this year, and I'm not surprised why - it turns out that Chibig, the independent studio behind the witchy title, is looking to two of my favorite things for inspiration: Studio Ghibli and Zelda. While Ghibli vibes are immediately obvious upon first glance at Mika, [<u>the video game version of Kiki's Delivery Service</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain-looks-like-the-video-game-version-of-kikis-delivery-service-and-the-whimsical-studio-ghibli-esque-indie-gem-is-coming-soon/), the upcoming game is also drawing from Wind Waker.

In a new [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/chibigstudio/status/1812857341634601189) comparing footage from Mika and Wind Waker side by side, Chibig reveals the charming Zelda game "was a great inspiration for the art of Mika and the Witch's Mountain." The attached clip shows little witch Mika running across sandy beaches, soaring above vibrant waters, and dodging obstacles - with Link doing much of the same in Wind Waker. Everything from character actions to the two worlds' art styles lines up between both games.

This means that Europa - another upcoming indie we've got our eyes on - isn't the only [<u>open-world take on Ghibli and Zelda</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/ive-been-obsessed-with-this-open-world-take-on-ghibli-and-zelda-for-months-but-its-indie-inspirations-are-just-as-exciting/) to look forward to - we cozy stans are truly eating good. I'm especially excited myself as Chibig, the developer behind Mika, previously headed Koa and the Five Pirates of Mara, another [<u>Ghibli-inspired platformer with its own Wind Waker vibes</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ghibli-inspired-platformer-with-wind-waker-vibes-blows-past-its-kickstarter-goal-by-600-and-i-can-see-why/). Mika and the Witch's Mountain is set to release next month on August 21, which means there's now not long left to wait for the studio's whimsical new adventure.
