Prior to the hotly anticipated release of [<u>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-even-if-some-friction-can-lead-to-frustration-its-realization-of-medieval-life-remains-utterly-absorbing/) today, Warhorse Studios dropped a fun CGI trailer showcasing the chaotic highs and lows of protagonist Henry's medieval life – a trailer aiming to be so realistic, it stars an actual horse.

That's right – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's recent [<u>CGI trailer</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju8R8gwD-Vg&ab_channel=WarhorseStudios) features a real horse. How did Warhorse pull that off? By bringing the horse into the motion capture studio just as the studio did with its human actors. A [<u>behind-the-scenes</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsBIQHxcLdk&t=1s&ab_channel=PlatigeImage) look at the creation of the new trailer highlights as much with a black horse covered in mocap gear trotting casually through the studio, a rider similarly geared up sitting atop the mount.

It's so quick, you might miss it – if it wasn't so wildly bizarre to see a horse in mocap gear – and it comes right after a scene featuring another actor "riding" a stationary mount dummy. This isn't the first time developers have used live animals to translate real-life movements to virtual ones more seamlessly, as proven by [Rockstar Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/rockstar-games/)' own [<u>past mocap work</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/k24ovv/motion_capture_for_horses/) for [<u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/red-dead-redemption-2-guide-walkthrough/), but it's just as amusing to see now as ever.

Fans seem to love the idea of a horse in a mocap studio still, too, with comments showing as much. "Bringing an actual horse to mocap a 5-second scene is insane dedication," reads one such reply. Another response sees a fan simply exclaim, "That's an entire horse!" That it is, and as both a devoted horse girl as well as a lover of all things medieval myself, I'd be lying if I said the short clip hasn't impressed me as much as it has others.

If you're just as blown away by the thought of a massive horse fitted in mocap gear, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is available to purchase now on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X | S, and on PC via [<u>Steam</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/) so you can experience the ultra-realistic mount mechanics yourself.
