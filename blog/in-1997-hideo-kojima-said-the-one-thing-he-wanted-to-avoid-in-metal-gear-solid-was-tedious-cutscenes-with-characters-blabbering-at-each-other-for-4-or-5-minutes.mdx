If there's one thing [Hideo Kojima](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/hideo-kojima/) is known for, it's his near movie-length cutscenes in his games. As it turns out, that wasn't originally how he planned to make video games.

In a 1997 interview originally published in Famitsu (uncovered by [<u>Shmupulations</u>](https://shmuplations.com/metalgearsolid1997/)), Kojima says "The one thing I want to avoid, though, are those tedious scenes where characters are just blabbering at each other for 4 or 5 minutes." All you can do is laugh when you read that given how long the cutscenes are in Kojima's games these days.

According to [<u>Barrier Four</u>](https://barrierfour.us/longest-cutscenes-in-video-games-history/), three of the five longest cutscenes in video games appear in Kojima projects. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a 24-minute one, but that's lightwork compared to the others higher on the list. Death Stranding has one that's 31 minutes.

I remember watching my housemate play [Death Stranding](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-review/) during lockdown and it felt like I was sat for a film. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I can see why that's not everyone's cup of tea.

Metal Gear Solid 4 really takes the cake, though. It has a cutscene that's a whopping 71 minutes long. That's the length of some horror movies.

Kojima did preface his early quote with the following: "I'm worried about the cinematic presentation. In order to make the direction effective, I feel like I may have to add unskippable cutscenes. The story for Metal Gear is very complicated, so I think cutscenes will be necessary." So, we can clearly see he decided to lean into the skid rather than find a workaround.

He adds, "For Metal Gear, too, I'm trying to get as close to film as possible. What I mean by that is an expansive, well-written setting, making the polygon characters 'act', and lighting effects [...] When you've finished Metal Gear, I want you to feel like 'ahâ€¦ I understand now.' That's my goal. In that sense, too, it's a cinematic or literary experience."

I'm a big fan of cutscenes. While it's great when a game can tell its story through gameplay and the environment, sometimes it's nice to just sit back and watch the drama unfold. One of my favorite video games, Jak 2: Renegade, held the record for the most cutscenes in a video game at the time, and I think it's what marked [Naughty Dog](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/naughty-dog/)'s shift into a studio known for telling great stories. I'm excited to see what the team does with [<u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-guide/).
