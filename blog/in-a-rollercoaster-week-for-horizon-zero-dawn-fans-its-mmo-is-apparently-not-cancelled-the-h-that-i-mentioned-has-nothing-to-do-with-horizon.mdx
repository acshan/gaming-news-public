> Rumors of a Horizon Zero Dawn MMO cancellation at NCSoft are debunked; the project reportedly remains in development, despite recent Sony live-service game cancellations.

Contrary to [<u>an earlier report</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/the-horizon-zero-dawn-mmo-has-reportedly-been-scrapped-following-close-behind-god-of-war-and-days-gone-dev-multiplayer-cancellations/), it seems that the [<u>Horizon Zero Dawn</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tips/) MMO at NCSoft is still in the works, according to a follow-up article.

On Tuesday, it was reported that several games had been cancelled at NCSoft. One of them was simply known as H, which was believed to be a Horizon MMO. However, [<u>Gameranx</u>](https://gameranx.com/updates/id/525464/article/ncsofts-horizon-mmo-cancellation-debunked-by-several-sources-including-the-original-reporter/) spotted posts on [<u>ResetEra</u>](https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot44-pro.1027578/page-376#post-134680350) and [<u>Reddit</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i6zdrw/the_reporter_of_the_original_article_for_horizon/) that say otherwise. 

The original reporter of the [<u>MTN</u>](https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267) article that caused people to believe a Horizon MMO had been canceled, Seo Jeong-geun, later clarified that "The 'H' that I mentioned has nothing to do with Horizon."

[<u>ThisIsGame</u>](https://thisisgame.com/webzine/news/nboard/4/?n=204939) states "the company's MMORPG project using the Horizon IP is still going strong" (translation provided by DeepL). "We have confirmed that these reports [that the game was cancelled] are not true."

While it's always sad news when any game gets cancelled, MTN did report that developers at NCSoft were being moved to other projects rather than laid off, which is good. 

But this latest development also means Horizon fans should be happy as the game doesn't appear to be cancelled. [<u>Sony did, however, cancel two live-service games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/playstation/playstation-cancels-unannounced-live-service-god-of-war-game-from-demons-soul-remake-studio-and-live-service-game-from-days-gone-dev/) last week. A God of War game by Demon's Souls Remake studio Bluepoint and an untitled game from Day's Gone developer Bend Studios. [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) did [region-lock Horizon Forbidden West on Steam](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-forbidden-west-is-region-locked-on-pc-10-months-after-release-for-some-reason-subjecting-millions-to-sonys-shenanigans/), so it's not all good news.

I wrote at the time of my previous article, I can understand why Sony decided not to pursue a God of War live-service game, but Horizon's world seems well-suited to the MMO formula, so I'm glad it seems to still be going ahead. It's going to be a tough time for all the live-service games Sony is funding at the moment, though, as it seems to be reducing its efforts in the area following [<u>the closure of Concord</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-is-officially-fully-permanently-dead-as-sony-announces-its-closing-the-failed-hero-shooters-studio-and-moving-on-we-will-take-the-lessons-learned/) just two weeks after its release.
