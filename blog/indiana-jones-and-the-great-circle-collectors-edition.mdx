The [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-game-bethesda-guide/) Collector's Edition gives you three days' early access to the game, and also includes a globe that's got a conspiracy theory scrawled all over it.

Revealed right at the end of [Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/) was the fact that [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is officially coming to PS5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-officially-coming-to-ps5-next-spring-after-a-december-launch-on-xbox-and-pc/) just a few months after its newly-announced PC and Xbox Series X release date of December 9, 2024. Revealed just after that were the game's Digital Premium and Collector's Editions, as well as their pre-order bonus.

The latter offers The Last Crusade Pack, kitting Indi out in his Traveling Suit outfit, as well as giving him a Lion Tamer Whip. The digital premium edition adds up to three days' early access (suggesting the game unlocks on December 6), and adds a digital art book, Indi's Temple of Doom outfit, and The Order of Giants story DLC.

Finally, there's the Collector's Edition, which has all of that, plus a steelbook, a copy of Indiana's adventure journal, and a replica of an in-game relic that comes with a code for the game. That's right, this is yet another Collector's Edition that doesn't come with a physical version of the game, but does come with a steelbook to store it in.

The centrepiece, however, is actually pretty cultured - a globe with the titular Great Circle scrawled on it. Conspiracy theory aside, we could all benefit from learning a little geography, and we could also all benefit from a secret place to hide things from people, which is what this globe also offers.Â 

Unfortunately, there's no price listed for any of these that I can see just yet, but I'd posit that if you did want a globe with a hidden compartment, you could probably get one for cheaper than Bethesda will sell this one for. Then, simply scrawl on it with a red marker to complete the effect.
