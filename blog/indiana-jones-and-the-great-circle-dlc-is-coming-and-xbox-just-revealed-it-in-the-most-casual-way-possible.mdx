[Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-game-bethesda-guide/) is poised to get at least one piece of story DLC, but you'd be forgiven for missing that fact given how casually it was announced.

During [Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/), we saw a new trailer for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that confirmed the game's December 9 release date on Xbox Series X | S and PC. This wasn't in the Gamescom stream, but if you check out the same trailer hosted on the official Xbox [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) channel, you'll see an end card [promoting the game's collector's edition](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition/).

In one corner of that card, there's a note that the collector's edition includes the Order of Giants story DLC, to be released at a later date than the game itself. An [announcement blog](https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/indiana-jones-great-circle-december-9/) from [Lucasfilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/lucasfilm/) is the only other spot where this DLC seems to be mentioned at all, with a simple addendum that there will be "more details coming soon." The DLC will also be available as part of a Premium Edition - presumably a step down from the Collector's Edition - and while there's no word if the expansion will be available separately, it's a safe bet that you'll be able to pick it up later down the line.

Of course, the big news today is the revelation that [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be on PS5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-game-ps5/) - just [several months later than the game's PC and Xbox versions](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-officially-coming-to-ps5-next-spring-after-a-december-launch-on-xbox-and-pc/). Sometimes the rumors turn out to be trueâ€¦ eventually.
