We've finally got an [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-game-bethesda-guide/) release date as part of [Gamescom Opening Night Live](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/) - and it was Geoff Keighley's duty to inform the world that it's also coming to PS5 next year.

Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is officially set on December 9, 2024 on Xbox Series X | S and PC via Steam. Confirming previous rumors, the game is also due to launch in spring 2025 for PS5. We can finally stop asking [if the Indiana Jones game will be on PS5](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-game-ps5/).

The game's appearance on PS5 had been rumored for ages, and [Phil Spencer addressed Indy directly when he spoke on the first round of Xbox games coming to rival platforms](https://www.gamesradar.com/4-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-starfield-and-indiana-jones-arent/), noting that the Great Circle would not be among the initial four multiplatform Xbox releases. Rumors of a PS5 version of the game intensified ahead of today's Gamescom reveal, and it seems *this* time Xbox has decided it's worth bringing the game to an additional platform.

Curiously, there's no mention of this PS5 release on any of the official dev channels - whether the [Xbox Wire blog](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-new-gameplay/), [Bethesda's announcement](https://bethesda.net/en/article/43bwH9MW6VHxNpAkrqeVnm/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-new-footage), or developer MachineGames' [Twitter account](https://x.com/machinegames). While Xbox is content to let Keighley spill the beans on the planned PS5 version, I suppose they're keen to continue marketing it as an Xbox and PC exclusive - which, for a time at least, it will be.

[<em>After seeing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's stealthy disguises, punchy hand-to-hand combat, and the iconic whip in action, it's one adventure I need in my life.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-august-2024/)
