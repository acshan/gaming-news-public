Update: It's official, folks – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle finally has a PS5 release date. Bethesda has confirmed that it'll be launching on [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/)'s current-gen console on April 17 (matching previous rumors).

Very appropriately for the game's debut on the PS5, the news was announced in a fun new trailer featuring Uncharted's Nathan Drake actor Nolan North chatting with Indy actor Troy Baker about adventuring. You can watch it below.

Pre-orders are open now for digital or physical editions of the regular ol' game, as well as the Premium edition (which includes two days of early access, as well as The Order of Giants story DLC, some in-game outfits, and a digital art book), and the physical-only Collector's bundle. The latter includes the same bonuses as the Premium edition, as well as a steelbook display case, a globe (which you can store things in), a journal, and a replica of the Allmaker Relic.

Original story: Heads up, Indiana Jones fans – Bethesda is teasing some kind of announcement for today, and it seems pretty likely that we might finally be getting [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's PS5 release date.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-game-ps5/)

In a tweet posted yesterday, Bethesda makes it pretty obvious that *something *related to [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.gamesradar.com/indiana-jones-game-bethesda-guide/) is being announced today. "Keep eyes here tomorrow," the developer writes, sharing an image of actor Troy Baker. Just in case there was any doubt about what this is about, the alternative text of the image states: "Troy Baker (who plays Indy in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle) is seen sitting in a mysterious room."

It's been known for some time that Indy's latest adventure will be arriving on PS5 at some point this spring, but earlier this month, reliable leaker Billbil-kun [<u>claimed that it's specifically gearing up to launch on April 17</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-reportedly-set-for-april-after-esrb-leak/). This claim surfaced around the same time as the PS5 version getting an ESRB rating, too.

Just to add even more fuel to the fire, it's worth noting that almost three hours before Bethesda posted its latest teaser, the [<u>same leaker stated</u>](https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1903783283785154729) that the PS5 release would be announced today. It's worth taking any unofficial leaks with a pinch of salt – there's still a chance that Bethesda could throw us all for a loop and announce something else Indy-related, like a new update or even a line of limited edition hats. However, considering that we're now comfortably into the game's spring release window, even leaks aside, it seems more likely than not that PS5 owners are finally going to be given their moment.

*In our *[<u><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/)*, we gave the game a full five stars, so needless to say it'll be worth picking up on PS5 if you've not played it already.*
