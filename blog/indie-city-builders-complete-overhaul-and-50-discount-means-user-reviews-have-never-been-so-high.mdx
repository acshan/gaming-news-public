Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles is reaching new heights after a complete game-wide overhaul.

You might remember The Falconeer as that flight-combat launch title for Xbox Series X|S that had you flying a massive, fierce bird across some gorgeous clouds and crashing waves. It was awesome, and solo developer Tomas Sala followed it up with a complete left-turn into a new genre.

Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles came out as a "dynamic strategy game where you build, expand and defend a grand civilization, with modes ranging from peaceful creativity to intense warfare," all set in the same cloudy, dramatic world as its predecessor.

Bulwark was already an accomplished, well-received city-builder, but Sala recently published an update that was so transformative, [the game also changed names from Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles to Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/city-builder/indie-city-builder-gets-an-update-so-huge-that-its-solo-dev-is-changing-the-games-name-to-match-it-marks-what-i-consider-as-close-to-a-10-version-as-i-can-deliver/). The, ahem, evolution comes from the open-world content doubling, progression becoming much clearer, and a new Total Conquest mode that puts you up against every possible faction in the game all at the same time. Chaos.

The sweeping changes have certainly made a difference, though. Salas recently [tweeted ](https://x.com/FalconeerDev/status/1832317430489571753)to say that "you folks are digging the evolution," alongside a screenshot of the game's recent [Steam ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/290100/Bulwark_Evolution_Falconeer_Chronicles/)user reviews that were 97% positive. "That's insane, it's never been this high, for an experimental game that messes up the conventions..." More user reviews have been logged in the days since thanks to a massive 50% discount that lasts until September 20.
