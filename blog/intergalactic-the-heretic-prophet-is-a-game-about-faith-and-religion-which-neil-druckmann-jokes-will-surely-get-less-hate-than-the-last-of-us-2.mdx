> Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann discusses the polarizing reception of The Last of Us 2 and the studio's upcoming sci-fi game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet,  a project intended to elicit less controversy, focusing on themes of faith and religion.

The story of [The Last of Us 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-last-of-us-2-guide-walkthrough/) proved to be absolutely polarizing, with some players loving it, others hating it, and some subset of the latter group engaging in an [ugly harassment campaign against the developers at Naughty Dog](https://www.gamesradar.com/naughty-dog-responds-to-the-abuse-and-harassment-of-those-who-worked-on-the-last-of-us-2/). The studio is now at work on [Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-guide/), a sci-fi game about religion that director Neil Druckmann jokes will surely get less hate than The Last of Us 2 did.

Druckmann spoke about Intergalactic's fictional timeline with 28 Days Later writer and Civil War director Alex Garland as part of [Sony's Creator to Creator podcast series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA). "I joke about this with the team," Druckmann said. "With The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game."

"Who gives a shit," Garland quipped.

"Exactly. But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about. Let's make a game about faith and religion," Druckmann concluded.

While the statute of limitations for spoilers from a 2020 video game might be up, I'll still refrain from speaking too directly about the "creative decisions" Druckmann is alluding to, since a lot of new Last of Us fans are presumably about to experience them as part of season 2 of the TV show.

But when it comes to spoilers, [Naughty Dog](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/naughty-dog/) took some extreme measures to keep the story of The Last of Us 2 from getting ruined the first time around, too. "I've gotten in trouble, actually, because of trying to protect the story," Druckmann told Garland. "We released a trailer for The Last of Us 2 where we faked a shot, and we showed Joel somewhere where he would never make it to because of things that happened in that story as a deliberate way to throw off the scent. People that didn't like the game accused that of being false advertisement."

"Again, who gives a shit," Garland responded.

[<em>For his part, Garland is quite a fan of Druckmann's work, saying that The Last of Us is "better" than 28 Days Later.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/the-last-of-us-is-better-than-28-days-later-says-movie-writer-alex-garland-this-is-so-much-more-sophisticated-and-moving/)
