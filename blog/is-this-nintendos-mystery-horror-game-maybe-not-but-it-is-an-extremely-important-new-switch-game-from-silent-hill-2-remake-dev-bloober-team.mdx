> Bloober Team, developer of Layers of Fear and the Silent Hill 2 remake, reveals Project M for Nintendo Switch, sparking speculation of a connection to Nintendo's mysterious horror project.

Layers of Fear and [Silent Hill 2 remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/) developer Bloober Team has quietly revealed that it's working on something called Project M for Nintendo Switch, and I'm perhaps irresponsibly wondering if it has anything to do with [the mysterious horror project Nintendo just revealed this week](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/is-nintendo-making-a-full-blown-horror-game-because-it-sure-looks-like-it-in-this-surprisingly-creepy-teaser-trailer-flagged-for-disturbing-content/).

I mean, the timing is interesting to say the least, right? Nintendo surprise-drops a teaser for what looks like its first full-blown horror game in ages, and almost exactly at the same time, Bloober Team reveals a horror project for Switch.Â 

Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno recently told Polish newswire [PAP Biznes](https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a) (machine translation via [Rely on Horror](https://www.relyonhorror.com/latest-news/bloober-team-announces-new-project-for-nintendo-platforms/)) that the "first announcements" of Project M will come "later this year," and that the project will "open our second-party portfolio under the Broken Mirror Games brand."

And while the budget for Project M is "significantly smaller" than games released under Bloober Team proper, the studio still views it as "extremely important due to our long-term plans," with Babieno adding, "We are working on it in cooperation with the world's best game creators for Nintendo platforms, so we cannot afford to create just a decent game." Babieno also said Project M is "a big development challenge due to its uniqueness."

Let's pump the brakes a bit. Bloober Team is opening up a second-party brand, Project M is its debut project, and it's being worked on by prominent developers for release on Switch. I'm cautious to infer too much from these quotes as they haven't been human-translated and thus could lack necessary context, and the message is a bit vague to begin with, but at first blush that all seems like pretty big news for a major developer to drop without an associated international reveal.

Regardless of the coincidental timing, there's no firm evidence that Project M is Nintendo's Emio horror game. Meanwhile, Bloober Team is gunning for the finish line with the [Silent Hill 2 remake set to release on PS5 and PC on October 8](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/).
