Josef Fares – founder of Hazelight Studios and director of game of the year winner [<u>It Takes Two</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/it-takes-two-review-hazelight/), as well as the massively popular [<u>Split Fiction</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/split-fiction-guide/) – looks back on his past games and tells us their "numbers" really weren't good.

"Here's the thing: there was always a big, big risk in the beginning," Fares says in an interview with the Edge newsletter. "But I have extreme confidence in what we do. I trust in the core [of the idea]. Brothers, A Way Out, It Takes Two – all the numbers looked really, really bad. Now it's different, because we've kind of become this big developer, but still, with those early games, I just felt like, 'The core is great, I just know it.' So, trust in your vision, and go with it fully. Don't back away from that."

It's unclear exactly what "numbers" he means, though, because [<u>It Takes Two reportedly sold over 20 million copies</u>](https://www.polygon.com/analysis/489856/it-takes-two-sales-20-million) by the end of 2024 – but it took a month to get to one million. By contrast, [Split Fiction sold one million in just two days](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-blows-it-takes-two-out-of-the-water-by-selling-1-million-copies-in-2-days-becoming-hazelights-fastest-selling-game-ever/), so clearly Hazelight is on the up.

Fares may have been referring to wishlists, pre-orders, some sort of market research to do with how much people wanted co-op games.

In our [<u>Split Fiction review</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-review/), we wrote that the title "cements Hazelight as the master of co-op games." I've loved Fares' games since his first, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and I'm glad he's had the support and investment from publishers to keep making the kind of co-op games he loves, too.

[Fares also praises EA](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-director-josef-fares-says-ea-has-always-been-super-good-to-his-studio-they-get-so-much-s-t-they-dont-deserve/) in his Edge interview, saying: "I'm gonna give EA props for actually believing in, and backing up, the vision. They never interfere. Sometimes, I think they get so much s**t they don't deserve. I don't know how they work with others, but with us, it's super good."
