[<u>Metaphor: ReFantazio</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-guide/) has only been out for a few hours, but it's already smashed through Persona 5 Royal's concurrent player record on Steam, and it doesn't look like it's slowing down any time soon, either. 

The enormous new fantasy JRPG from Studio Zero was [<u>met with critical acclaim</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-metacritic-score-confirms-a-new-certified-jrpg-banger-as-the-persona-devs-latest-effort-ties-with-astro-bot-as-one-of-the-best-games-of-the-year/) when its reviews went live earlier this week – including from my own [<u>Metaphor: ReFantazio review</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-review/) for GamesRadar+, in which I gave the game four and a half stars out of five. It appears that its player count is set to reflect that, because it's taken no time at all to soar to [<u>38,713 concurrent players on Steam</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/2679460/charts/) – on a weekday, hours after launch – and surpassing Persona 5 Royal's all-time [<u>peak of 35,474</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/1687950/charts/#max), which it set two days after its release in 2022.

Despite coming from the creators of Persona 3, 4, and 5, [<u>Metaphor: ReFantazio isn't a Persona game, although in some ways, it certainly feels like one</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/persona/how-metaphor-refantazio-is-like-persona/). Even so, Persona 5 Royal – the definitive edition of Atlus' 2016 JRPG – has felt like the one to follow. It's held onto its fanbase tightly for years, and there's a reason why it's widely considered to be one of the [<u>best JRPGs</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-jrpgs/) of all time. Clearly though, Metaphor: ReFantazio might be on track to be just as beloved. 

At the time of writing, Metaphor: ReFantazio's Steam concurrent player count record is still lagging behind Persona 3 Reload's, which [<u>hit 45,002</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/2161700/charts/#max) a couple of days after its launch in February. Given that I've already had to edit what Metaphor's own record is twice while writing this story, however, it's fair to say that there's a good chance it'll overtake the remake yet.
