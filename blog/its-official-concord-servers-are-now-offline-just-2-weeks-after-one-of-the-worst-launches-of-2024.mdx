Well, it's official, folks: Concord is gone. The hero shooter FPS launched just two weeks ago to the day, but after poor sales and lukewarm reception, [PlayStation halted sales, refunded all copies](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-is-being-taken-offline-this-week-and-everyone-is-getting-refunds-as-playstation-tries-to-determine-the-best-path-ahead/), and now it's pulled the game offline entirely.

[After an eye-watering eight years in development](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/new-playstation-fps-concord-was-in-development-for-about-8-years-starting-almost-exactly-when-2016s-overwatch-got-hero-shooters-trending/), Concord's abrupt and shocking cancellation makes it a stronger contender for the worst launch of 2024, and arguably one of the poorest performances of any online game of the last decade or so. I can only think of a few off the top of my head whose launch states and shutdowns overshadowed the game itself to such an overwhelming degree. 

Anthem, maybe? But at least [EA and BioWare <em>tried </em>salvaging that with post-release content](https://www.gamesradar.com/anthem-roadmap-cataclysms-post-launch-support-new-endgame-activities-and-more/) and then [a switch to seasonal updates](https://www.gamesradar.com/anthem-is-ditching-its-acts-structure-in-favor-of-seasonal-updates/) before ultimately [cancelling all future content](https://blog.bioware.com/2021/02/24/anthem-update/) two years after its launch. Somewhat similarly, in 2015 Turtle Rock took a lot of heat for [Evolve's infamous 44 DLC packs](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evolve-launches-with-lots-and-lots-of-dlc/1100-6425237/) and the general development direction at launch, but it still stumbled through a [months-long comeback strategy](https://www.pcgamer.com/evolve-stage-2-details-revealed/) that culminated in the scrapping of future content plans in October 2016 and, ultimately, [the shutdown of dedicated servers](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-end-is-near-for-evolve) in September 2018. [There was a faint attempt at reviving the zombie shooter in October 2022](https://www.gamesradar.com/dead-sci-fi-shooter-shows-signs-of-life-as-2k-looks-to-support-a-rush-of-evolve-fans/) when 2K reenabled the free-to-play Evolve: Stage 2 servers, but [the servers were taken down "for the final time" in July 2023](https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/14706625253395-Evolve-Server-Sunset-2023).

I'm genuinely struggling to remember any instance where an online game of Concord's profile - that is, from a publisher as big as PlayStation - was taken down just weeks after it went live. And refunded, at that. Regardless, Concord is no longer playable and PlayStation's plans for the IP are unclear aside from the [recent report claiming it'll still rather awkwardly be a part of Amazon's anthology TV series Secret Level](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-shows/report-concord-is-still-going-to-be-part-of-amazons-new-anthology-tv-show-secret-level-despite-its-abrupt-cancellation/).

In the final days of Concord's short life, [it was filled with players throwing themselves off maps as quickly as possible in a desperate attempt to unlock the game's Platinum trophy](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-is-now-filled-with-players-throwing-themselves-off-the-maps-as-quickly-as-possible-in-a-desperate-attempt-to-unlock-the-shooters-platinum-trophy-before-it-goes-offline/). Now that the game's offline, whoever wasn't able to snag one is presumably out of luck for good, so as we bid farewell to the short-lived hero shooter, let's also pour one out for the trophy collectors who missed out.
