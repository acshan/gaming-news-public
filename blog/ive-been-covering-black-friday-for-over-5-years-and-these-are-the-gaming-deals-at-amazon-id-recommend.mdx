It's that time of year again, so the gaming deals are flying thick and fast at Amazon in honor of Black Friday. Yes, I know - the sale doesn't officially start until next week. But Amazon doesn't seem to have gotten the memo, so here we are.

Discounts on everything from laptops to accessories are tumbling down like a bargains avalanche, and it's easy to feel numb when you're buried to the eyeballs in all those savings. That's why I've corralled what I think are Amazon's best gaming deals of Black Friday so far. I've been covering the event in one form or another for more than five years (I started at GamesRadar+ back in 2018), so have plenty of Opinions‚Ñ¢ about what you should prioritize. Consoles, virtual reality headsets, Pokemon cards... honestly, the trouble was calling it a day before this page stretched into the far distance.

Want to go off-piste and find more discounts after you're done here? Not to worry, our [Black Friday gaming deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/black-friday-gaming-deals/) hub is here to help.
