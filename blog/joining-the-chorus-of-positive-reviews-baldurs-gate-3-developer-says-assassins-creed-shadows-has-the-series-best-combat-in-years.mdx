We haven't even hit its first weekend yet, but praise for [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-shadows-guide/) can be found in just about every corner of the interweb - and joining the chorus of positive reviews is [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/)'s publishing director Michael 'Cromwelp' Douse.

The Larian Studios lead chimed in on the game in a new social media post. "I really like the combat in AC Shadows," he [wrote](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1902744697094754549?t=DxK6lGrH_6CTkg99phpOLg&s=19) before comparing it to the AssCreeds of yesteryear. "It feels tight and deliberate, with a welcome return to the clear counter system I missed. Best AC combat system in years." One commentor added that they felt the combat in the series' other RPG offerings - Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla - felt too MMO-like, to which Douse simply responded, "Bingo."

He's not the only one showering [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s Japan-set open world with praise, though. Our [Assassin's Creed Shadows review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-review/) called it "a titan in the same leagues as series staples Assassin's Creed 2 and Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag â€“ and Ubisoft's best RPG to date," even if the story didn't quite take advantage of its two ultra-cool new protagonists Yasuke and Naoe.

It's a sentiment that was pretty much echoed by most as [Assassins' Creed Shadows' average rating almost exactly matches Assassin's Creed Valhalla's](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-metacritic-score/), while its concurrent [player peak on Steam has already beat the mega-popular Viking romp](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/), and we haven't even seen what kind of crowd Yasuke and Naoe can pull during a weekend yet.

If you'd like to make the most of the game's combat, be sure to check out the [best skills for both Yasuke and Naoe](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-best-skills-mastery/) and find out how to unlock them by finding [Knowledge Points around Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-knowledge-points-rank/) big, big map.
