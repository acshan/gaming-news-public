The [<u>new Persona 5 mobile spin-off</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-new-persona-5-mobile-spin-off-honestly-looks-great/) has landed on Steam in the form of an early playtest, but only with a mysterious placeholder page so far - and when it does go up, it'll likely be locked to Japanese clients only for now.

Following the recent success of Atlus' monumental [Metaphor: ReFantazio](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-guide/) release, fans are chomping at the bit for more of the developers' JRPGs - and while Persona 5: The Phantom X is a spin-off from Black Wings Game Studio, it features fan-favorite elements of the [<u>Persona</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/persona/) series nonetheless with some gacha flair mixed in. It might not be Metaphor, but it's something - and interested Japanese players can likely dive in soon.

Just last month, developers revealed in a [<u>post</u>](https://twitter.com/P5X_Official_JP/status/1838802594086740448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1838802594086740448%7Ctwgr%5E68548b84a9c48a95d4ec7b1048a1c9ed0149eac3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fpersona-5-phantom-x-steam-release-japan-only%2F) that the game would no longer be exclusive to China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan - it would be available to Japanese fans as well, on both Steam and mobile platforms. Sure enough, a mysterious Steam page has now appeared for a Phantom X playtest. The beta doesn't seem to be accessible just yet, however, as the listing looks like it's only a placeholder that redirects interested users.

There's no telling when the listing on [<u>Steam</u>](https://steamcommunity.com/app/3216950/) will truly go live as of now, but fans are already taking to the "Discussions" tab with their thoughts. "What in the world is this," asks one such curious commenter. Another quotes lyrics from some of the Persona series' past games while dubbing the playtest "Peaksona." As a longtime fan of Atlus' JRPG gems myself, I'm just hopeful the spin-off will make its way overseas one day - but until then, I'll watch from afar.
