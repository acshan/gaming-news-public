Spooky season has well and truly come early this year thanks to a trailer at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Spring Showcase for a first-person cinematic psychological thriller called Karma: The Dark World.

The trailer starts with morbid shots of a panicked man and a less-than-hospitable environment that doesn't linger for long. Over all of that, we get the narration: "Tell me, do you think the glimpse of a memory is the absolute truth? You don't get to choose to see the events that led up to these memories, or what transpired after." Whatever is going on here, it's hard to say we can trust it.

The rest of the trailer continues to the same vibe as we see twisted beings and rooms once a source of comfort set ablaze. We finish with the detail that Karma: The Dark World is set to release on March 27 on PS5 and PC.

Set in an alternative version of 1984 East Germany, Karma: The Dark World is a psychological terror that sees a company called the Leviathan Corporation control its citizens through mass surveillance, social class rules, mind altering drugs, and the promise of something more if you play by the rules.

You take the role of a government agent called Daniel McGovern, tasked with diving into the minds of the accused to investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report back. Naturally, what's real and what isn't is constantly called into question, leading to questions over your own sanity as something deeper unravels.

Karma: The Dark World is out on PC and PS5 from March 27.
