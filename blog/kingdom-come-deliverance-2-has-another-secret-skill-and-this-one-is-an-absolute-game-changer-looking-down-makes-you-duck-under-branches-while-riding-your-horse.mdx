[<u>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tips/) is stunning us all with its immersion and hidden skills, and this one will help you defeat the game's deadliest enemies of all: branches and fallen logs.

Have you ever been trotting through the beautiful wilderness of Bohemia and been knocked clean off your horse by a pesky branch you didn't notice? It's downright embarrassing, but fortunately, there's a very easy way to avoid them â€“ just look down.

This secret skill is shared by FabioDracul on [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) in a video that shows them simply looking down at their horse's mane while exploring a forest path littered with fallen trees and branches. "I heard that I can duck by looking down," they say, before exclaiming, "I can duck by looking down!"

This is an absolute game-changer. No longer will you have to circle round debris or awkwardly remount your horse after nearly having your head smashed in. It isn't a guaranteed get-under-the-branch-free card, though. You still have to use your, well, head. If a beam is clearly too low to even duck under, you won't magically crawl. So, if you see a log at a slant, aim for the highest point and then look down to shimmy beneath the obstacle.

I wish this existed in [<u>Red Dead Redemption 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/red-dead-redemption-2-100-completion-guide/). I'm replaying it right now, and if I look away for even a second while galloping, I risk being knocked to the ground.

This is just one of many [<u>hidden skills</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-several-secret-skill-buffs-that-can-be-unlocked-with-pure-dedication-to-role-play-so-youd-better-hold-onto-that-blacksmiths-apron/) that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has. Did you know that if you wear a blacksmith apron and gloves, you'll get a bonus for your craftsmanship skill? And if you wear glasses, you get a buff for your scholarship skill, which means you can read books faster. Maybe Henry is a bit short-sighted and just doesn't realize it.

There's even a system that dictates [<u>what kind of objects NPCs will pick up</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-just-got-even-better-to-me-after-watching-this-video-showing-npcs-scavenging-and-a-dev-explaining-nobles-might-ignore-cheap-items-but-beggars-will-pick-them-up/) from the floor. Rich ones wouldn't dare to be caught grabbing food off the street, but they'll pick up valuable jewelry instead. I love little details like these.
