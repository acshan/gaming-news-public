[Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tips/) includes an amusing reference to [Skyrim](https://www.gamesradar.com/skyrim-guide/)'s heavily memeified guards, who, if you remember, frequently enjoy reminding you that they took an arrow to the knee that one time.

This Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 encounter was shared on Twitter by Game Heroes' Blaine Smith, and it shows Henry having a conversation with an NPC who's sporting an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Now, if you've ever played an RPG, you might assume at first that you'd simply stumbled upon a glitch of some kind, but no, this encounter is very much intended and is a pretty obvious nod to Skyrim.

After Henry understandably inquires about the thing sticking out of the guy's forehead, the character explains: "It's an arrow. Well, what's left of it, that is. A metal arrowhead and a bit of a wooden shaft. It used to be longer, but I broke it off after I nearly took a wench's eye out with it."

Henry then remarks that he once "heard of a bloke that took an arrow to the knee," clearly referencing Skyrim's guards. "Hah! To the knee? That's nothing," the NPC responds. "You could go dancing the next day with a scratch like that. But, have you ever heard of anyone who took one to the head and lived to tell the tale?"

According to [Fextralife](https://kingdomcomedeliverance2.wiki.fextralife.com/Arrow-head), you can find this legend of an NPC in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 by heading down the path between Grund and Devil's Den. Interacting with him and choosing the right dialogue options will eventually open up the "Arrow-head" side quest that rewards you with seven Groschen upon completion.
