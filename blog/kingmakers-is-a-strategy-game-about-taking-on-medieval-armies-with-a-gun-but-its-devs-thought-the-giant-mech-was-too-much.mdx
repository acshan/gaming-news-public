Even if you don't immediately recognize the name Kingmakers, there's a good chance you've seen its [absurdly flashy gameplay go viral](https://www.gamesradar.com/i-am-begging-you-to-watch-more-than-23-seconds-of-the-trailer-for-my-most-anticipated-strategy-game-of-the-year/) on social media. It's the game where you can mow down thousands of medieval knights using an assault rifle and storm a castle in a fancy sports car, but despite all of its off-the-wall ideas, its director says giant mechs were just a step too far.

Speaking to Edge Magazine in its latest issue, [out now](https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/), game director Paul Fisch reveals the team "did have a giant cyborg" at one point in development, "like a titan unit" that would "march around and move soldiers out of the way." But after playing around with the idea, "we discovered *that* was too much. It was immersion breaking. Ultimately, it broke the fantasy."

At its heart, Kingmakers is actually a strategy game. Sure, you can zoom in and give your medieval enemies a taste of the future first-hand, but you can just as easily zoom out and command the battlefield top-down. "It's like a hybrid strategy game," Fisch explains. "If you give a guy an assault rifle, when he starts fighting thousands of people, he's surrounded and shut down. You actually need to build a town and cultivate an army and have generals."

Interestingly, over time, your foes will begin to recognize and react to your unfamiliar tech: "The people in the past start counter-balancing. You're this force on the battlefield that they recognise, and they start fielding things to try to stop you."

Kingmakers is scheduled to enter early access on [Steam ](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109770/Kingmakers/)sometime this year.
