LAN Party Adventures just got revealed as part of [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Live, and it absolutely captures some serious nostalgia for the early 2000s.

As the game's name suggests, part of what you'll be doing in the game is setting up a good old-fashioned LAN party, complete with perfect dial-up internet tones.

That includes making sure your chunky grey desktop PC is linked up to your monitor with the right cables, and then jumping through the required hoops to get on the clunky internet of the times. It's going to be a beautiful mess of cabling and peripherals.

However, it's not just about the set-up as your pal Pedro is also missing. In order to find out what's happened to him, you'll have to collaborate with your LAN party pals, solving puzzles and following digital clues.

A series of LAN parties will bring you to the truth, but will also present fresh opportunities to make your setups even grander by unlocking various upgrades and new tools.

Outside of the mystery of Pedro, you can also dive into Sandbox Mode, which will let you dial up your parties from net cafes all the way to industry-scale events. Grab retro-inspired posters and seemingly endless accessories, and start customizing your computers for the ultimate LAN party experience without the real-life pain of dial-up.

LAN Party Adventures is due to launch later this year on PC via Steam.
