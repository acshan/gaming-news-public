The Kickstarter campaign for Frosthaven was, at the time in 2020, the most successful board game campaign that the site had ever hosted, earning over a staggering $12 million in the short time it was live. Well, that popularity has pushed Frosthaven's success even further, as an announcement trailer in the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) has revealed that now it's being transformed into video game format.

Frosthaven itself is a sequel to Gloomhaven, considered by many to be one of the truly great board game creations, arguably the best of all time to many tabletop fans. Clearly cognizant of the fact that it has a heck of reputation to live up to, the PC port of Frosthaven is readying all sorts of features for launch: six character classes with more to unlock, an outpost you develop over time, and over 35 playable quests at launch, with 130 planned for the full release. You'll be able to make a party of four in either co-op or single player, and build working strategies with large array of cards. Speaking personally, I like the look of the necromancer with the "Bride of Frankenstein" hairdo.

Frosthaven will be coming soon to early access, planned to appear on Steam at some point within 2025. That being said, there's an even earlier opportunity for those who are excited to try it out. On March 27, 2025, players will be able to sign up for the chance to participate in a closed beta, slinging swords and sorcery at orcs and undead before anybody else and try out the transition to PC first.
