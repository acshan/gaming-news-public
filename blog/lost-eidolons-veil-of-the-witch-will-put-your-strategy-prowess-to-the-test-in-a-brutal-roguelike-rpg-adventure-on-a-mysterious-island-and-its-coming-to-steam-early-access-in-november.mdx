Brutal new strategy-infused RPG Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch has a new trailer, revealing it'll be out later this year in November via Steam Early Access, and next year in 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch platforms.

Earlier today at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) at Gamescom Presented by Sid Meier’s Civilization® VII, South Korean developer Ocean Drive Studio revealed a brand new look at Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. Stranded on a mysterious island and facing down the fangs of scores of beasts, your only option is to recruit as many allies as possible and take off foes tooth and nail in a tough turn-based RPG gauntlet.

Keep your wits about you and utilize a huge arsenal including swords, spears, axes, and destructive magic to battle back the beasts and prove your worth to the enigmatic witch on the island as you strive to become her champion. Environmental hazards can be your savior or spell disaster in the heat of Veil of the Witch's crunchy, punchy combat system. 

Veil of the Witch is quietly a follow-up to 2022's Lost Eidolons, also developed by Ocean Drive Studios. Lost Eidolons was a Fire Emblem-infused tactical strategy game taking place across a grid system, but Veil of the Witch takes things in an exciting new direction by opening up the battlefield to give you more control over the movements and positioning of your heroes. 

This Lost Eidolons adventure is infused with a roguelike system, demanding you bolster your characters and abilities in between every run to uncover more about the island. Veil of the Witch boasts nine playable characters with combined skill numbering over 200, all of which can be permanently upgraded, as well as dozens of other persistent upgrades to unlock and master for your heroes. 

Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch is out later this year in November, available first on Steam Early Access. Everyone else won't have too long to wait though, because the latest adventure in the Lost Eidolons world will be launching just a matter of months later in Q2 2025 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.
