The beautiful 2.5D Metroidvania meets Soulslike, Mandragora, has shown off more of its sword-slashing, monster-killing gameplay at this year's [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/). Along with the new look at the game, developer Primal Game Studio also confirmed a release window targeting later this year, with new publishing partner Knights Peak. 

Think The Witcher meets Ori and the Blind Forest as you battle monsters, mixing magic and weapons in brutal combat to slay creatures; using your abilities to explore deeper into the world of Faelduum, and tackling difficult morel choices in a narrative crafted by Brian Mitsoda - best known for crafting the story in Vampire: The Masquerade. 

While it's rich in atmosphere and character, Mandragora is a challenging combat experience. Pick a class and then customize your skills and abilities in a deeply satisfying RPG development system. Battle vampires and dragons, Wargs, the undead and more as you unlock upgrades and craft the gear you need to progress and defeat vicious bosses barring your way. 

As well as developing the tools you need to save Faelduum from the monsters tearing it apart, you'll also develop the gear and skills needed to unlock the world. Things like a grappling hook to swing to new areas or the Witch Lantern, which lets you enter the otherworldly plane of Entropy through tears in the fabric of reality.
