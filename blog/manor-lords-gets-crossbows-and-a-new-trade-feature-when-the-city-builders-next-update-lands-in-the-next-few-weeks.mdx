Manor Lords' developer has previewed its next patch, which is set to launch within the "next few weeks." It boasts crossbows, ponds, new portraits, and a whole game engine switch.

Slavic Magic just published a [Steam post](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/4374767864888445285), listing all the features coming in Manor Lords' next big update. The game engine switch to Unreal Engine 5 is obviously a pretty significant feature, but we've known this was coming for weeks, back when the developer said last week that it was [focusing on keeping performance as smooth as possible after the switch](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/city-builder/hit-city-builder-manor-lords-is-switching-to-unreal-engine-5-soon-but-its-dev-is-being-careful-about-enabling-performance-heavy-features-to-help-keep-things-running-as-smoothly-as-possible/).

"In response to popular demand, fishing ponds will be added," Slavic Magic writes in the post, but again, we've known the [city builder's next patch would add fishing ponds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/city-builder/this-is-not-a-drill-manor-lords-fishing-ponds-are-coming-in-the-next-update-since-it-was-requested-a-lot/) since last week. This will also see a new development branch, dubbed 'Winter Fishing,' which when unlocked will allow fishing all year round, even when the ponds literally freeze over.

Another big feature is crossbows, a new ranged option for Manor Lords players. Right now, there are two ranged units in the city builder: Archer Militia with 'warbows' and both Heavy and Light Mercenary Archers. It's unclear if the crossbows will feature as part of a new unit type in Manor Lords, or just a new option for existing unit types.

The Manor Lords patch also features two new character portraits - a weathered old man and a youthful young woman - as revealed in the Steam post. The Steam post also reveals that "a trade overview in the development screen will list all the previous transactions done by the region." Finally, a bug fix will prevent fleeing deer from getting stuck on the terrain.
