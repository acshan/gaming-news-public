We are very close to living in a world where, instead of diamonds, or gold necklaces, or calf leather handbags, people purchase each other the newest $70 or $80 multiplayer title as romantic consolation gifts. Bungie, which will soon release the promising new extraction shooter [Marathon](https://www.gamesradar.com/marathon-guide/), isn't helping by being so secretive about the game's as-of-yet undisclosed price tag.

"Marathon will be a premium title," Bungie writes in [a Twitter post](https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129310498636053). "Marathon will not be a 'full-priced' title."

The admission is as murky as a puddle. While Bungie's use of "premium" here refers to what we recognize in our [Marathon hands-on preview](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-hands-on-preview/) to be the PvP game's stunning, intergalactic style and oiled-up, smooth controls, I'm a little paranoid that it also means Marathon will be $8 million.

Or, really, more like $50 or so. A "full-priced title," as Bungie says, could now refer to anything from the new, industry-standard [$70 price tag](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/dont-like-dollar70-games-monster-hunter-wilds-and-dragons-dogma-2-publisher-capcom-says-wait-5-years-and-theyll-all-be-dollar5/), to Nintendo's more [ambitious $80 cost for Mario Kart World](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-sony-exec-says-nintendo-can-charge-usd80-for-switch-2-games-because-of-its-exclusives-if-its-the-only-place-you-can-play-mario-then-you-get-your-wallet-out/), or its downright hubristic [$90 Switch 2 copy of Breath of the Wild](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/the-full-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-experience-on-switch-2-will-cost-usd90-including-dlc-as-nintendo-confirms-the-expansion-pass-isnt-included-in-the-re-release/).

In the realm of paid extraction shooters like Marathon, the fire is tempered a bit as red-hot Helldivers 2 costs $40 and Hunt: Showdown 1896 costs $30 â€“ though many other popular titles like Delta Force are free-to-play, as Marathon skeptics have noted.

"Not being free to play will hurt it big time," quips a [popular reply](https://x.com/cruzjandr0/status/1911129616418570633) to Bungie's post on Twitter.

"If it wasn't bad news you'd announce it now," [says another](https://x.com/basedtweetsonly/status/1911129516933599648). Marathon will launch September 23 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, so it's only a matter of time before we find out.

[<em>Marathon feels like a good extraction shooter, but it's not free-to-play, and I hope Sony and Bungie don't price it into an early grave</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/marathon-feels-like-a-good-extraction-shooter-but-its-not-free-to-play-and-i-hope-sony-and-bungie-dont-price-it-into-an-early-grave/)*. *
