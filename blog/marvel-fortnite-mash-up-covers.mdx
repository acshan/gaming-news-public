The worlds of [Marvel Comics](https://www.gamesradar.com/comics/marvel-comics/) and [Fortnite](https://www.gamesradar.com/fortnite-guide/) are colliding once again in the [current season of the smash hit video game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fortnite/fortnites-new-doctor-doom-update-has-the-chance-to-turn-you-into-a-living-breathing-boss-battle-with-enormous-laser-beams-and-an-even-bigger-health-bar/), dubbed 'Absolute Doom'. Now, just as the game is introducing yet another new game mode which pits Marvel heroes and villains against each other in a massive clash along with [even more Marvel themed weapons](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fortnite/fortnites-new-iron-man-gear-is-ridiculously-good-and-even-the-overpowered-doctor-doom-powers-are-struggling-against-it/), Marvel Comics is bringing a bit of Fortnite into the Marvel Universe with a line of variant covers featuring some of the current Fortnite season's Marvel x Fortnite mash-up characters.

First up there's Captain Jones, who combines Fortnite's familiar Agent Jones character with Captain America. Then there's Meowtooth, a mash-up of Sabretooth and the cute kitty-faced Meowscles. Next up is Ghost Ri-Durr, a combination of Ghost Rider and Durr-Burger who has a flaming hamburger for a head. And finally, the icon among icons, Peelverine, who combines none other than Wolverine with Peely for a version of Logan who is - you guessed it - a giant banana.

If that sounds ridiculous, it is - and it's meant to be. Marvel's latest Fortnite collab has everything that's great about the smash-hit game, and the mash-up skins embody the wild fun that comes from seeing all kinds of characters meeting up in one place. 

Here's a gallery of the covers, including Meowtooth on the cover of X-Men #7 and Ghost Ri-Durr on the cover of Spirits of Vengeance #3, both by Afu-Chan, along with Peelverine on the cover of Wolverine #3 by Iban Coello, and a cover for Avengers #20 featuring an image of the actual Captain Jones outfit taken straight from the game:

"The Marvel Universe has collided with the world of Fortnite once again in the hit video game’s latest Season - ABSOLUTE DOOM! In addition to new Marvel character Outfits, special crossover Outfits that combine Marvel characters with iconic Fortnite original characters are also available," reads Marvel and [Epic Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/epic-games/)' description of the variant covers. "To coincide with the current Season, Marvel Comics will be presenting these mashup Outfits on variant covers throughout November."

Avengers #20 goes on sale November 6 along with X-Men #7, followed by Wolverine #3 on November 20, and Spirits of Vengeance #3 on November 27.
