Marvel Rivals game director Thaddeus Sasser shares on LinkedIn that NetEase laid off his entire, US-based team [despite the hero shooter's sky-high popularity](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-is-more-popular-than-ever-soaring-past-570k-steam-players-to-set-a-new-record-as-season-1-launches/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_content=gamesradar). "This is such a weird industry..." Sasser writes in [his LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/thadsasser_this-is-such-a-weird-industry-my-stellar-activity-7297672154060361729-xYIX?). "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games [...] and were just laid off!""Oh well!" Sasser continues. "Times are tough all over â€“ let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right?"In [<u>spring 2024</u>](https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1829342570042048776), Chinese publisher NetEase started making [<u>dramatic cuts to Visions of Mana developer Ouka Studios</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/visions-of-mana-has-only-been-out-for-a-day-but-its-developer-has-reportedly-lost-most-of-its-staff-and-is-at-risk-of-shutdown/). Then, at the end of the same year, NetEase [<u>reportedly transferred</u>](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-staff-laid-off-at-netease-after-relaunched-hyper-front-fails-to-meet-expectations) members of its central staff after it was disappointed by mobile game Operation Apocalypse's local launch; that shooter has since been shut down. This time, we don't yet know the extent of NetEase's latest round of layoffs, and the company has not yet responded to GamesRadar+'s request for comment.

As of now, it appears that Marvel Rivals' entire US team has been wiped out. Former level designer Garry McGee says as much [<u>in another LinkedIn post</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297717165019803649/), lamenting the fact that "my team recently helped develop and launch Marvel Rivals, which turned out to be a bigger hit than any of us expected! Unfortunately, my team was also laid off."

"Strange times all across the industry indeed," McGee continues.

Former level designer Jack Burrows shares a similar sentiment [<u>in his own LinkedIn post</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297445172118724608/), sharing that it "was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling. Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."

As of writing, Marvel Rivals has over 200,000 concurrent players, and the game issued a [<u>mid-season update</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-devs-are-trying-to-curb-the-triple-support-meta-starting-with-cloak-and-dagger-nerfs-and-buffs-to-venom-and-magik/) earlier today.

[<em>No, Marvel Rivals developer NetEase isn't intentionally planting fake leaks to mess with everyone, but its datamined characters aren't guaranteed to appear in the future, either.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/no-marvel-rivals-developer-netease-isnt-intentionally-planting-fake-leaks-to-mess-with-everyone-but-its-datamined-characters-arent-guaranteed-to-appear-in-the-future-either/)
