Marvel Rivals just announced, excitingly, that The Thing and Human Torch [<u>are finally coming</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-upcoming-characters-new-leaked/) to the hero shooter on February 21, but it seems like most players are too furious about the game's new mid-season rank reset to notice.

No offense, The Thing and Human Torch – you Fantastic Four members look very strong and intimidating in your promotional images. Personally, I would hate to be a torch or boulder person, so good for you.

That said, these superheroes are getting overshadowed like it's a lunar eclipse by Marvel Rivals' mid-season rank reset, which will make players fall four divisions when it also launches on February 21.

"For example, if you ended the first half of Season 1 at Diamond I," says [<u>a Marvel Rivals dev diary</u>](https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html), "you'll start the second half at Platinum II."

Players don't like the sound of that. Marvel Rivals already has a seasonal rank reset, which drops players down six divisions – *two* unsparing rank resets might make gameplay feel like a depressing chore. Developer NetEase's decision here, by the way, comes only months after League of Legends developer [<u>Riot announced</u>](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-ranked-update-season-one-2025/) walked back its infamously back-breaking rank resets for one, massive yearly reset.

"This has to be the dumbest decision I've ever read," says one popular reply to Marvel Rivals' announcement [<u>on Twitter</u>](https://x.com/X37Dj/status/1889009086248931355).

"Why on God's green earth do we need a mid-season rank reset?" [<u>wonders another player</u>](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/600770111531398979/) on Steam.

On Reddit, Marvel Rivals players are ready to revolt, feeling crushed by the "truly devastating news," as one [<u>hugely upvoted thread</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1imc7bi/from_the_most_recent_dev_talk_this_is_truly/) says.

"I can promise you NOBODY wants to have their rank reset halfway through every season," the Reddit post continues. "People have JOBS. I don’t have the time to re-rank up every few weeks.

Out of everything great about this game, this WILL make me and my friends stop playing."

[<u><em>Marvel Rivals is killing it right now, but there's one more thing it needs to borrow from Overwatch to truly thrive</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-is-killing-it-right-now-but-theres-one-more-thing-it-needs-to-borrow-from-overwatch-to-thrive/)*.*
