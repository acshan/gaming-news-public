2024 has proven to be a very bad year for publishers launching new live service games, with big titles like XDefiant, Concord, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League all failing to find an audience. This week's release of [Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/) might just have bucked the trend, however, as the superhero shooter has already claimed one of the biggest free-to-play launches in Steam history.

Marvel Rivals reached a peak of 444,286 concurrent players on Steam shortly after its launch last night, as [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/) shows. Obviously that doesn't even include players on console or those using the standalone PC launch, but purely in terms of Steam releases, that's the second-biggest-launch for a brand-new free-to-play game ever, behind only the MMO Lost Ark, which reached a staggering 1,325,305 concurrent players day one on [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s platform.

There are some caveats to that stat, as several games which debuted on Steam as paid titles and later went free-to-play enjoyed bigger numbers the first day they stopped costing money. Such was the case with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and PUBG. Relaunches like Counter-Strike 2 and Warzone 2.0 also attracted bigger concurrent player numbers. But considering we're talking about a handful of the most successful free-to-play games ever made here, it's safe to say Marvel Rivals is in good company.

Given the headlines live-service games have tended to generate in 2024, it feels downright miraculous to see a new one doing this well at launch. [Suicide Squad proved a financial disappointment for publisher Warner Bros](https://www.gamesradar.com/hogwarts-legacy-was-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-but-warner-bros-says-it-wants-to-focus-on-free-to-play-and-live-service-games-even-after-suicide-squad-setbacks/), [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s [XDefiant is going down with numerous devs laid off as a result](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/xdefiant-is-shutting-down-as-ubisoft-closes-san-francisco-and-osaka-offices-following-long-journey-of-free-to-play-struggles-up-to-177-devs-impacted/), and [Concord shut down just weeks after launch](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-is-officially-fully-permanently-dead-as-sony-announces-its-closing-the-failed-hero-shooters-studio-and-moving-on-we-will-take-the-lessons-learned/) with its development studio closing down a short time later. And hey, remember Foamstars? Square Enix's easy-to-forget foam party shooter both launched and [announced an end to updates](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/the-party-never-ends-in-splatoon-like-shooter-foamstars-except-it-does-because-square-enix-is-pulling-the-plug-on-new-seasons-but-not-before-a-nier-automata-crossover/) in 2024.

Marvel Rivals has launched in a good position to outdo all of those games, but whether it can maintain those early players remains to be seen. Our [Marvel Rivals review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-review/) argues that it's "so preoccupied with trying to be like Overwatch that it forgets to play to its own strengths," but the early response in [Steam user reviews](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=4777282#app_reviews_hash) has been tentatively good, with 74% positive ratings.[<em>After Redfall and Suicide Squad, Concord's failure must be the nail in the coffin for the industry's failed live-service gold rush.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/after-redfall-and-suicide-squad-concords-failure-must-be-the-nail-in-the-coffin-for-the-industrys-failed-live-service-gold-rush/)
