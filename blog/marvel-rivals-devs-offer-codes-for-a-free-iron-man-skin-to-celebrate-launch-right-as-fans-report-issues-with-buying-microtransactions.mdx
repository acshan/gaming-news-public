Marvel Rivals is officially out now and available for free to players on both consoles and PC, but the hero shooter's long-awaited launch hasn't come without its issues, including problems with microtransaction purchases - but never fear, NetEase Games has swooped in with a solution and [Marvel Rivals codes](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-codes-redeem/) for some free cosmetics to boot.

Fans playing [Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/) on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/) may be aware of a problem with making purchases for the game - and it seems the developers are, too. Addressing the issue in a recent [post](https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864876777119895701) online, NetEase explains that the team has  "noticed that some players are encountering" a setback while trying to make purchases and outlines a set of guidelines to follow if in need of a fix. These include restarting Steam and enabling [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s overlay.

The devs also recommend "reinstalling Steam and then restarting the game" if the problem persists. Fans aren't too thrilled by the post, however, with many commenting and calling it "greedy" of NetEase to address the issue with purchasing and not other "problems that players are having." It isn't the only recent announcement from the devs, though, with a more well-received [update](https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1864824576175128653?t=MuiJRWyoYdAHVbtYCjCzjA&s=19) arriving just a few hours earlier.

"To welcome you all to the game," writes NetEase, "use code nwarh4k3xqy to redeem the Iron Man Armor Model 42 costume now!" The key grants players a unique Iron Man skin and is valid until March. It's a "sick" offer from the devs, as fans put it, and is available to all. If you haven't had a chance to dive into the shooter yourself yet to input the code, it's out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.
