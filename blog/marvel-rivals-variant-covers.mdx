The covers feature concept art by the team at developer NetEase Games of characters Spider-Man, Venom, Magik, and Storm, along with a cover by Peach Momoko featuring Galactus' daughter Galacta and Jeff the Land-Shark. Here's a gallery of the variants, followed by a list of the titles they'll appear on and their release dates:

"The merciless clash between tyrannical dictator Doctor Doom and his future counterpart from the year 2099 has forced countless universes to collide in the Timestream Entanglement, creating new worlds and crises unknown," reads NetEase Games' official description of Marvel Rivals. "Now, Super Heroes and Villains from across the multiverse must fight together and against one another as disparate groups each seek to best both Dooms before one achieves domination of these realities. Familiar faces become newfound foes while former enemies become the greatest of allies in Marvel Rivals!"

Marvel Rivals is a team-based first person shooter where players take on the roles of various Marvel heroes and villains, utilizing their unique powersets to beat the enemy team in three different game modes. So far, 26 characters have been announced for the game, which will be free-to-play.
