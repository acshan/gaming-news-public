Now that [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard/) is in players' hands, many [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) fans are already looking ahead to what's to come with the developer's upcoming project [Mass Effect 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/mass-effect-5-guide/). And BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently shared a recommendation for what new fans should experience when getting into the sci-fi series.

In a post on the [social media site formerly known as Twitter,](https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1862916932326039624) Gamble suggested fans should revisit the infamous Mass Effect 2 DLC Lair of the Shadow Broker. So far, details on the next Mass Effect are slim aside from a teaser poster and an early reveal trailer showing the familiar N7 logo and a returning Liara T'soni, which makes Lair of the Shadow Broker a particularly interesting suggestion.

So many new Mass Effect fans popping up in my mentions. Maybe because it’s like 5 bucks or something. Awesome to see. There’s like an extra game worth of DLC content in there but make sure you play Lair of the Shadow Broker. Thx.[November 30, 2024](https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1862916932326039624)

As a refresher, Lair of the Shadow Broker is a DLC mission pack for Mass Effect 2 focusing on Liara T'Soni's quest to find and hunt down the elusive Shadow Broker, the leader of a mysterious black market organization with access to vital information that high-profile clients pay to gain access to. The DLC mission is perhaps best played as a post-game quest, which saw players reunite with Liara from the original Mass Effect, continuing her story and a possible relationship if players formed a bond with her previously.

What makes the Lair of the Shadow Broker mission so vital is that it carried over into Mass Effect 3, which saw – sorry for spoiling – Liara assume the role of the Shadow Broker and take over the organization in secret. Given that Liara is one of the characters highlighted in the Mass Effect 5 teaser and that she's become one of the most influential people in the galaxy in her new role, it should stand to reason that her part in the post-Reaper invasion of the galaxy will be a large one.

While some community members are still sore about Andromeda being left unresolved in favor of a sequel to the original trilogy, it is interesting to see BioWare looking to continue with threads and a new storyline following Mass Effect 3's still-controversial ending.
