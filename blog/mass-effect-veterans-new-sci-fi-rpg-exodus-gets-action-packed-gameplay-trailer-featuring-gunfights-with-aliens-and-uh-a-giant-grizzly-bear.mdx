Exodus, the debut game from a team of [BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) veterans under Archetype Games, has debuted a new gameplay trailer showing off the third-person combat system.

[Archetype first announced Exodus right about a year ago at The Game Awards 2023](https://www.gamesradar.com/exodus-is-a-new-time-dilating-rpg-from-halo-the-last-of-us-and-baldurs-gate-veterans-that-oozes-mass-effect-energy/). The studio is led by BioWare stalwart James Ohlen, who was the original Dungeon Master of the pen-and-paper campaign that spawned the Baldur's Gate franchise. He was also designer on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and game director on Star Wars: The Old Republic, staying with BioWare until 2018.

The new Exodus gameplay trailer, packed to the brim with Mass Effect vibes, shows our profoundly attractive protagonist traversing various surfaces using a grappling hook and doing battle with aliens and some sort of giant, armored grizzly bear. The combat looks like a fairly straightforward and conventional mix of third-person shooting and melee battling, but it seems satisfying enough.

The story is set in a universe where humanity has fled a dying Earth only to find itself struggling for survival in a hostile alien galaxy. [It will have branching narrative paths that lead to different endings depending on player choice](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/mass-effect-veterans-new-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-teases-that-all-your-missions-are-gonna-include-choices-that-have-impact/), which should be familiar to fans of the developers' previous work. Although we know [Mass Effect 5](https://www.gamesradar.com/mass-effect-5-guide/) is officially in development at BioWare, Exodus sure seems like something of a spiritual successor to the series, which just means fans of story-driven sci-fi RPGs are eating good.
