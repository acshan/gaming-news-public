Upcoming multiplayer sci-fi shooter Mecha Break is opening applications for closed beta tests on PC and Xbox Series X.

Imagine if [Titanfall 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/titanfall-2-pilot-helmet-collectibles-location-guide/) and [Armored Core 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/armored-core-6-review/) had a baby. That's Mecha Break. I played it at Gamescom last year and it seems to have undergone a lot of changes since then. As reported by [<u>Automaton</u>](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mecha-break-opens-applications-for-large-scale-closed-beta-featuring-revamped-pvpve-mode/), this closed beta will let you jump into a revamped PvPvE mode that implements changes based on previous player feedback.

If you want to check it out for yourself, beta signups are live now and close January 14. The exact time of the closed beta hasn't been disclosed yet, but the game is due out sometime this year so you shouldn't have to wait too long. If you want to apply, just fill out a survey on the [<u>Mecha Break website</u>](https://wenjuanxing.xoyo.com/vm/PFIWX3w.aspx?udsid=625225).

When I played Mecha Break at Gamescom, I was surprised by the cynical and archaic use of booth babes, but once I saw the character creator I was less surprised. You can [<u>customize the size of your pilot's butt</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/online-multiplayer-game-mecha-break-soars-past-50000-concurrent-steam-players-in-its-playtest-who-all-discover-just-how-unhinged-its-character-creator-can-be/) and they bounce in a way that would make Stellar Blade take notes, but the game itself was actually fun to play. 

I tried the PvP mode and, thanks to my dozens of hours in Armored Core and Titanfall, I did pretty well. The combat is frenetic and tense, and strategy and teamwork are important. It all stood up well on its own merits, so it's odd and almost sad to see it resort to cheap titillation to attract players.

Fortunately, one of the game's producers did go on record saying [<u>pay-to-win features would be "out of the question"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/mecha-break-producer-says-pay-to-win-is-out-of-the-question-for-the-upcoming-mech-action-game/) when the game launches, and the devs "won't allow it" in the future.
