Iconic Metal Gear Solid actor David Hayter is teasing his return as Big Boss, and naturally, fans are spiralling.

"I was in the booth today. Playing a role Iâ€™ve not played, sinceâ€¦" reads a tweet from Hayter that was followed up by a gif of Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.

To be fair to said fans, there is justified confusion around what Hayter appears to be teasing here. We have Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater coming out sometime this year (the exact date has yet to be announced), but [Konami said back in May 2023](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes) that it was using the same recorded voice lines from the original game. Sure, [it did say later that a select few lines were being re-recorded](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-3s-remake-retains-the-original-cast-but-reconstructs-some-old-unused-clips-for-new-voice-lines/), but it seems unlikely they'd be doing so this late in the game, with less than three months left in the year.

Then there's the unconfirmed, but [heavily alluded to](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-4-still-hasnt-been-confirmed-for-modern-platforms-but-a-konami-producer-says-you-can-probably-connect-the-dots/), Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2, but that seems even less likely to have any re-recorded lines from Hayter, being more of a straightforward port.

Finally, the most dubious of speculation is that Hayter is teasing a brand new entry in the Metal Gear franchise. [Konami](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/konami/) hasn't said anything at all about a potential [Metal Gear Solid 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/metal-gear-solid-6-guide/), but when has that ever stopped fans from speculating? And to that end, please enjoy this stream of Normalâ„¢ reactions to Hayter's tweet from fans:

That settles it, Metal Gear Solid 6 100% confirmed. Thanks, David.[October 4, 2024](https://twitter.com/TheGamingCynics/status/1842230507540447319)
