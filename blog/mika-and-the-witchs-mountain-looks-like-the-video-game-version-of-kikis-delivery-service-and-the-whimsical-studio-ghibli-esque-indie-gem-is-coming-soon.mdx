Mika and The Witch's Mountain, an adorable upcoming indie adventure game reminiscent of Kiki's Delivery Service, just got a release date - and it's not too far off.

In just a couple of months, I can finally live out my witchy little dreams in Chibig's cozy new game, Mika and The Witch's Mountain. Alongside a brand-new trailer, the studio reveals that its enchanting title is coming to PC and the [Nintendo](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/) Switch later this summer, on August 21. For anyone unacquainted with Mika and The Witch's Mountain and its cute coming-of-age gameplay, it follows a magical young girl as she works to deliver packages to the residents of a vibrant island.

The [Studio Ghibli-inspired courier sim](https://www.gamesradar.com/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain-fgs-spring-showcase-2023/) sees players explore the small island as the aspiring witch, all while riding a flying broom. There are friends to be made, packages to be delivered, and one ultimate goal for Mika to eventually accomplish - to reach the tippy-top of the island's mountain via her broom. While the [indie game](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/indie-game/) is certainly wholesome, it isn't all smooth sailing for the youthful witch. Players need to protect Mika's packages from the elements to ensure top-notch deliveries - through birds, water, wind, and all.

I personally can't wait to channel my inner child and experience the world as an ambitious witch. If you're just as excited to soar the skies atop Mika's magical broom as I am, you can wishlist Chibig's game now on [<u>Steam</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1819460/Mika_and_The_Witchs_Mountain/) ahead of its big launch in August. This isn't the indie developer's first relaxing rodeo, either - the team previously released Koa and the Five Pirates of Mara, a [<u>Ghibli-inspired platformer with Wind Waker vibes</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ghibli-inspired-platformer-with-wind-waker-vibes-blows-past-its-kickstarter-goal-by-600-and-i-can-see-why/), as well as life sim Summer in Mara.
