YouTuber and Minecraft architect Grazzy [<u>recently finished building</u>](https://x.com/ImGrazzy/status/1870224779950584136) Breath of the Wild's entire, surreal open-world map in the sandbox game after three years of toiling. 

"I'd put this idea off for so long because of one simple reason: it's impossible," Grazzy says in [<u>a recent video</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmdl2Wu7PO0) explaining how he brought Nintendo's wistful cel-shaded world to the land of cubes. "Replicating every patch of ruins, every settlement, every Guardian – that would be hard enough on its own, but how would I even replicate the terrain of Hyrule itself?"

With help, it turns out. Grazzy used the open source [<u>Minecraft map editor WorldPainter</u>](https://www.worldpainter.net/), which allows users to sculpt and draw detailed landscapes, to convert a map of Hyrule to stacks of Minecraft blocks. 

From there, Grazzy and a tiny group of Minecraft friends dedicated over 2,000 hours to shading, terraforming, and birthing many trees.

"One of the most tedious tasks at the [beginning of the project] was placing in all of the trees," Grazzy says in his [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) video. "I was literally placing every tree one at a time." 

By 2024, Grazzy's map was appropriately full of forests and flying dragons, and he became more determined to complete it. 

"Being so close to the end," he says, "I was more motivated than I ever had been. My schedule was cleared, and I put everything else aside to solely focus on finishing this project."

The result of all this brain-melting work is what turned out to be a spectacular Breath of the Wild replica. [<u>You can now download</u>](https://grazzy.sae.sh/) the miraculous map for free, and [<u>Grazzy notes on Twitter</u>](https://x.com/ImGrazzy/status/1870874742380466486) that it can be played in Survival mode.
