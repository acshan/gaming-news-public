Monster Hunter Wilds' first month sales are substantially higher than Monster Hunter World's from 2018, says a prominent industry analyst.

We already have plenty of data we can point to as measures of Monster Hunter Wilds' success. Right around its launch, [it beat out titans like Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 with a peak concurrent player count of 1.3 million on Steam](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-almost-1-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-in-1-hour-surpassing-elden-ring-and-nearly-tripling-monster-hunter-worlds-all-time-peak/), and then [it broke records as the first Capcom game to cross 8 million sales in just three days](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-breaks-a-capcom-record-as-the-action-rpg-passes-8-million-sales-in-3-days-the-fastest-a-title-has-reached-this-milestone-in-the-companys-history/). [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) marked that milestone with a tweet assuring fans[ "this is just the start for the next generation of Monster Hunter."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-promises-this-is-just-the-start-for-the-next-generation-of-monster-hunter-as-wilds-shatters-sales-milestones-the-guild-authorizes-this-celebration/)

Now we have a new Big Number from Circana analyst Mat Piscatella on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqhsujgus2v), who reports Monster Hunter Wilds' total US launch month sales are 40% higher than its closest predecessor and competition, Monster Hunter World, which launched back in January 2018. (Monster Hunter Rise is the previous game in the series, but was initially a Nintendo Switch exclusive, whereas Wilds is practically World 2.)

Granted, Monster Hunter World retailed at $60 while Monster Hunter Wilds is $70, and World's PC launch came seven months after its console launch while Wilds launched on all platforms simultaneously, but 40% is a notable leap regardless.

So what's making Monster Hunter Wilds such a successful entry in the long-running series? Well, no one quite knows for sure, but [producer Ryozo Tsujimoto recently attributed part of it to the game's increased focus on story](producer%20Ryozo%20Tsujimoto). Meanwhile, our [Monster Hunter Wilds review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-review/) suggests it might be topping sales charts because it's just a really good video game, with Austin calling it "the new peak of the series and an early contender for game of the year."
