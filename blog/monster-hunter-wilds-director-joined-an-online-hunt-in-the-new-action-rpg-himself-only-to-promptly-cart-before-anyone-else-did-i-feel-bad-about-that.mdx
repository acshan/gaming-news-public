As [<u>Capcom</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) continues working towards its [<u>first free update</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-update-coming-early-april-will-crank-up-the-difficulty-and-add-a-new-place-to-hang-out-with-other-players-addressing-2-big-concerns/) for [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/), with new monsters like Mizutsune coming to the action RPG, director Yuya Tokuda reveals that he's been playing the game online himself – and it hasn't exactly been smooth sailing.

Speaking in a recent [<u>video</u>](https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1900483317390000416) message on Monster Hunter Wilds, Tokuda first acknowledges how many players the new game has reached and shares his appreciation for the community. "Firstly, I'm really happy to see how many people are enjoying the game around the world," says the director. He then goes on to recount how he tried to answer a multiplayer SOS flare to hunt Gore Magala – an attempt that didn't go too well.

"I recently joined a Gore Magala hunt via an SOS flare, only to promote cart before anyone else," admits Tokuda, much to producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and art director Kaname Fujioka's delight. "I felt bad about that, but we did manage to clear the hunt!" The three leads then promise that there's still [<u>"lots in store" for Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-promises-lots-in-store-for-monster-hunter-wilds-beyond-just-the-planned-title-updates-not-to-mention-the-series-as-a-whole/) beyond just "the planned title updates," not to mention the "series as a whole."

While Tokuda's admission is amusing, to say the least, he's certainly not the only one who worked on what our own [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds review</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-review/) calls "the new peak of the series" but found actually playing it challenging.
