[Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) is well and truly upon us, which means that the latest edition of Fashion Hunter is here too. The standout dress-up option for Palicos is the Felyne Nu Udra set, which turns your fuzzy companion into a l'il octopus buddy. It exists within the perfect twilight zone between cute and creepy, and players are so obsessed that they're doodling fan art that even [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) can't help but share.

Nu Udra is an octopus monster, so it's no surprise that the resulting Palico armor is all octopus-ish, but the slithering tentacles of the Nu Udra set are so otherworldly that it looks less like a costume and more like a full-on transformation into an adorable extraterrestrial. It's even cuter when you ditch the head piece and see your Palico's little kitty face peaking out from the cephalopod body.

GamesRadar+'s own resident Monster Hunter sicko Austin Wood shared his Nu Udra Palico for the headline image above, and players across social media have been doing the same. There are numerous [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j1arvm/palico_uth_dunanu_udra_helmetbody_is_hilariously/) celebrating [the armor set](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1j0nxsu/nu_udras_palico_armor_is_so_precious/), and even more tweets from players sharing their octocats. Please, keep scrolling and enjoy the majesty.

THE PALICO NU UDRA ARMOR IS A GREEN OCTOPUS! pic.twitter.com/i1wwCv5BqH[March 2, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1896089940569833645)

The Nu Udra Palico is clearly a hit, and Capcom itself has shared a tiny bit of fanart of the, uh, creature. Just look at that hapless little kitten face peeking out from a tentacled body. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.
