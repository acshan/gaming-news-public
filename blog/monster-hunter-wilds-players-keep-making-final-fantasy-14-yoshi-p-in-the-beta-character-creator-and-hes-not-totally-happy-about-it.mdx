People are making all sorts of fun faces in [Monster Hunter Wilds beta](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-how-to-access/)'s character creator, from real life celebrities to cursed creatures, but some have even been battling the big beasties with a character that looks awfully like a very tired version of Final Fantasy 14's beloved director Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida - and he's seen them all. 

The [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) beta is well underway and everyone plus their parents seems to be playing it, judging by [the half a million concurrent users it managed to pull in on Steam alone](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-pulls-in-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-steam-players-some-of-which-are-being-turned-into-ps1-style-low-poly-blobs/). Mentions of [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/)'s early teaser even invaded an official Final Fantasy 14 broadcast, too.

In the latest Final Fantasy 14 [Letter From the Producer episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp5OGIamHDU), the MMO's frontman Yoshi-P was reading through comments in chat (around the 2 hour, 25 minute mark in the video) where one fan congratulated him on his appearance in the upcoming Monster Hunter, which obviously left him confused until fellow [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) producer Toshio Murouchi told him that fans have been sculpting his likeness in-game.

"I haven't checked social media, but apparently they made me into a character, and I look tired?" Yoshi-P asked, according to translations from [twitterer ](https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1852411545214693503?t=NY3kz3sqU4qXrgcd6J8aTA&s=19)AitaikiMochi. "I have to apologize to the Monster Hunter team for my unseemly presence then."

I think Yoshi-P has nothing to apologize for, based off some of the badass action poses he (or his in-game doppelgangers) pulls off above. Plus, the man seemingly hasn't taken a big break ever since the MMO's revival and massive comeback more than a decade ago - if anyone has the right to be tired, it's probably him.
