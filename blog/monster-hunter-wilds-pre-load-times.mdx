The Monster Hunter Wilds pre-load times are nearly here, which is wondrous news for those who want to ensure they can play [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/)'s latest game as soon as it drops.

Due to release on February 28, [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) is the World follow-up many – us included – have been waiting years for. In fact, in our [Monster Hunter Wilds review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-review/), we call it "the new peak of the series and an early contender for game of the year."

"With the best combat and narrative in a 20-year series of action RPGs, Monster Hunter Wilds is the new peak of Monster Hunter, only further enlivened by a colorful cast of monsters that defies longtime design conventions," we said.

That's all well and grand – the game is good. The next thing you may wonder if you've already pre-ordered the game is how you go about the launch. First, you'll want to pre-load the game so you're not waiting on launch day. How that works depends on your platform, so here's what Capcom says.

You can find a handy infographic [here ](https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1892741205106069878)if you're wondering what the Monster Hunter Wilds launch times are. Those on the East Coast in America will enjoy a few hours of the game early, though I imagine most of us will be saving it for another day – or staying up quite late otherwise.
