[Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) and [Activision](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/activision/) are reportedly forming a new team under the Blizzard umbrella to work on smaller games based on its popular series.

Before absorbing the publisher in an arduous acquisition, Microsoft Gaming President [Phil Spencer](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/phil-spencer/) said he wanted to [chat with Activision Blizzard about "what could happen"](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-boss-says-what-could-happen-to-dormant-activision-blizzard-franchises-like-starcraft-is-pretty-exciting/) with the company's "back catalog" post-buyout. As soon as the deal was finally done and dusted, Spencer didn't spare a second to publicly joke about a dormant magical FPS' return: ["When's Hexen coming back?"](https://www.gamesradar.com/phil-spencer-wants-to-see-classic-fps-hexen-return-and-the-system-shock-remake-dev-wants-to-do-it-my-team-are-very-well-suited-for-the-job/)

[Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip) now reports that Microsoft is making good on its promises, and has approved the creation of a brand new team that mainly consists of many former King (Candy Crush) staff. Windows Central sources claim that the "smaller" studio is tasked with creating AA games in pre-existing Blizzard series - which might be anything from Overwatch and Warcraft spin-offs, to some form of Starcraft revival - because Microsoft is apparently "increasingly concerned about the monstrously ballooning [AAA] costs."

Balatro, Palworld, and Manor Lords, as well as Microsoft's own Grounded, have been heavyweight successes despite being made by relatively lean teams, meanwhile, [blockbuster game budgets](https://www.gamesradar.com/former-playstation-head-thinks-game-budgets-will-be-a-hot-topic-in-2024/#:~:text=Earlier%20today%2C%20former%20Sony%20Interactive,than%20%24300%20million%20to%20make.) can now cost several hundreds of millions of dollars to make and still barely scrape even. 

Blizzard's new arm fits right into comments made by [Xbox Game Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/xbox-game-studios/) boss Matt Booty, who said the company needed ["smaller games that give us prestige and awards"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hi-fi-rush-lead-reacts-to-xbox-exec-asking-for-smaller-games-that-give-us-prestige-and-awards-right-after-closing-studio-that-made-prestigious-award-winning-smaller-game/) - days after shutting down a Hi-Fi Rush makers Tango Gameworks and Prey engineers Arkane Austin, two teams that made relatively smaller, award-winning. Tango Gameworks did slot right in, according to Windows Central, but the richest company in the world apparently found "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult."
