Acclaimed racing wheel manufacturer MOZA certainly made the most of Gamescom 2024, bolstering its industry-leading output with a range of new products, as well as an entire new line, dedicated to excellence in Flight Simulation.

The new flight simulation gear has been developed in collaboration with season pilots, and makes use of MOZA's proprietary force feedback technology. Currently available are the AB9 base, which uses dual servo motors to offer precise, dynamic feedback, and the MH16 joystick which replicates real fighter jet controls. 

That might sound impressive on its own, but MOZA took the opportunity of Gamescom to unveil the brand-new MA3X Sidestick. Compatible with all MOZA bases, it's a simple addition to your flight setup, but one that can take some serious force thanks to its ultra-rigid composite material. The perfect addition to the MH16, it allows up to 12 extra inputs for intricate control.



Of course, if you prefer your simulations a little closer to the ground, MOZA still had you covered at Gamescom thanks to the MOZA Porsche Mission R. Crafted in collaboration with the iconic car manufacturer, it's a faithful replication of the original vehicle's steering wheel. Combining MOZA's hardware with Porsche's design, you'll be able to take advantage of its 5.4-inch OLED display to offer real-time data on everything from speed and lap time to ABS and traction control.



Sticking to the track, MOZA also introduced two new pedals; the MOZA mBooster Pedals offer quick-change functionality so you can change up your pedals via MOZA software, but also replace traditional springs with a motor and ball screw systems, combining with dual 200kg pressure sensors for ultra-accurate feedback; elsewhere, the CRP2 Pedals make use of a patented sensor fusion algorithm, combining a 15-bit angle sensor with a load cell sensor to dial up braking precision. With a direct connection to your PC, as well as an aviation-grade aluminum construction and carbon fiber heel plate, its adjustable pedal feel is perfect for all types of racing cars.



Finally, there's the officially-licensed ESX Steering Wheel, continuing MOZA's close relationship with Xbox to provide the best-possible console support across a huge range of games, and MOZA's Multi-Function Stalks, with 28 programmable switches to cover the likes of turn signals, wiper, headlight, and cruise controls. Compatible with all MOZA bases, the Multi-Function Stalks are the perfect addition to a dedicated trucking setup.



The ESX Steering Wheel and CRP2 Pedals are currently available to purchase via the [<u>official MOZA website</u>](https://mozaracing.com/), while the Multi-Function Stalks and MA3X Side Stick are currently available for pre-order.
