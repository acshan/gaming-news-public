Fretless - The Wrath of Riffson, the upcoming musical turned-based RPG, just dropped a duo of big reveals as part of the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/).

Firstly, we got confirmation of the game's release date, with Fretless set to launch on PC on May 15, 2025.

Secondly, developer Ritual Studios revealed two more special guests for the game's soundtrack. The OST will now include metal band Cult of Luna and guitarist-producer Rabea Massaad among its ranks, with other musicians already confirmed including Northlane, Andrew Huang, and Davie 504.

You can get a taste of how the new OST guests will sound in-game with the trailer that just dropped in our Future Games Show Spring Showcase, which features the two bosses the musicans will accompany.

Fretless - The Wrath of Riffson is a turn-based RPG where you'll be engaging in a musical combat system. You play as Rob, a musician trying to restore the world's harmony after Rick Riffson, the CEO of Super Metal Records (SMR), starts stealing the souls of the best musicians during the Battle of the Bands.

You'll collect riffs and add them to your deck so you can build songs to take out your foes. There are four instruments to rock out with, each with their own associated strategy and special abilities that you'll want to work out how best to utilise. Just remember to play on the beat!

This handcrafted pixelart game will take you on a visual journey too, though music-themed lands inspired by American musician Rob Scallon.

You'll be able to join the jam session yourself when Fretless - The Wrath of Riffson drops on PC on May 15 via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store.
