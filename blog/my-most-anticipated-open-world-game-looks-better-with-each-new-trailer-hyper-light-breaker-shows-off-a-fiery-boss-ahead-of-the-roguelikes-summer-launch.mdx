Open-world roguelike Hyper Light Breaker is launching in Steam Early Access this summer, as developer Heart Machine affirmed in a new trailer showing off another slick boss fight.

Heart Machine was one of the many indie devs included in today's joint Triple-I showcase, and as ever, Hyper Light Breaker was a personal highlight for me. The follow-up to the 2016 classic Hyper Light Drifter, which builds mechanically on the stellar 3D movement Heart Machine demonstrated in its previous game [<u>Solar Ash</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/solar-ash-review-ceaseless-distilled-fun-the-best-type-of-game/), expands the universe with an ever-changing 3D world that's functionally bottomless. [<u>It could well be one of the biggest roguelikes of the year</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/with-bottomless-open-world-combat-hyper-light-breaker-could-be-the-biggest-roguelike-of-2024-in-more-ways-than-one/) in more ways than one, and this new boss is yet another challenge to look forward to. 

The star of today's trailer is the aptly named Flame Wizard, who packs a mix of melee and ranged attacks, teleports, and seemingly a chunky melee buddy who I'm going to call the Flame Warrior. The Flame Wizard fight looks a little less bullet hell than some of the other bosses we've seen, though there are still clearly a lot of attacks to dodge.

Hyper Light Breaker has been described as a combat-first experience glued together by slick movement, mounting progression like gear unlocks and light settlement expansion, and an evolving narrative tied to the mysterious Overgrowth. Boss fights are front-and-center, with rich lore backing each one, [<u>like the Last Master swordmaster</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/i-didnt-think-my-most-wanted-open-world-game-could-get-any-cooler-and-then-its-bosses-went-full-elden-ring/) who could just about slot right into a [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/fromsoftware/) tapestry. The Flame Wizard joins a rapidly growing ensemble of threats, and I'm as eager as ever to take them on for myself, and maybe again with some buddies in online co-op.
