My Talking Angela's 10th anniversary celebrations are underway, and to keep the party going, a brand-new feature has been added to My Talking Angela 2.

Fashion Editor is a premium feature now available in [My Talking Angela 2](https://o7n.co/mkt-mta2fe-mta2-pr-general). Released as part of the celebrations of Â the 10th anniversary of My Talking Angela's initial launch in 2014, it gives players the chance to express their own individual style by designing custom wardrobe items for Angela. With the help of a 360-degree view that gives you the chance to paint and style outfits from every angle, it's now easier than ever to bring your most fashionable ideas to life.



As Angela's personal fashion designer, you'll be able to create truly unique styles. And there's no limit to your creativity, since every design you create will be saved to Angela's wardrobe, letting you return to previous designs and combine them with your new creations. Once you've decided what piece of clothing you want to work with, you'll be able to adjust colors, patterns, and lengths, and draw and paint designs for a unique final look.



Fashion Editor is just one part of Angela's anniversary celebrations, with 'Party with a Friend', a special 10-year event , featuring a very special crossover, also already underway within the game. If you want to create Angela's next fabulous look for yourself, [you can download the My Talking Angela 2 game via Google Play or the App Store](https://o7n.co/mkt-mta2fe-mta2-pr-general). And you can join the Party with a Friend event any time before November 19, 2024.

**Please Note: In some territories, the Fashion Editor feature may be subject to an additional purchase.*
