Mobile virtual pet game My Talking Angela is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a new in-game event marked by an exciting brand crossover in My Talking Angela 2.

My Talking Angela was first released in 2014, and was followed by its sequel, My Talking Angela 2, in 2021. Now, ten years after that initial launch, it's time for Talking Angela to celebrate this milestone with the help of a special anniversary event. Party with a Friend will run in the My Talking Angela 2 game from November 28 to December 19, giving Angela a host of new activities to partake in - and a friend to enjoy them with!

Party with a Friend will mark the first-ever character crossover between Talking Angela and Talking Tom. Tom will make his debut appearance in Angela's world during the event, helping his friend organize the perfect birthday party across five fun, creativity-filled stages. 

Angela and Tom will be able to decorate Angela's balcony with personalized decorations, deciding on everything from the tables and flooring options to the disco lights, and even a sandy beach to watch the sun go down over. Once you've settled on the perfect ambiance, you'll be able to help Angela and Tom create their own cake, picking out the shape, color, and decorations for their sweet treat. And after that, it'll be time to dress up both Tom and Angela, and it's up to you to decide whether they'll be attending the party in suave, chic outfits or in something a little more whimsical.



With everything prepared, it's time to let the celebrations begin. And there's plenty of fun to be had - whether you're watching fireworks, catching fireflies, breaking a piñata, or simply hitting the dancefloor (where you can choose the disco ball under which Tom and Angela dance), you're sure to have an amazing time. 

Finally, you'll be able to commemorate Angela's 10th anniversary with a special gift - an exclusive birthday outfit to remind you of ten years of adventures with Angela. If you want to get in on the excitement, you can download the [My Talking Angela 2 game via Google Play or the App Store](https://talkingtomandfriends.com/apps/my-talking-angela-2?utm_source=pr&utm_medium=general&utm_campaign=mkt_10ymta2_mta2_pr_general), and join the party any time before December 19, 2024.
