[<u>Steam Next Fest</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/steam-next-fest/) has been an absolute delight this year, bringing plenty of demos along to explore - and Tinkerlands' own might just be the best slice of a survival game that I've tried yet.

At first glance, Tinkerlands reminded me of a couple of different games. Firstly, I thought of [<u>Terraria</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/terraria/) - a sandbox survival gem I hold close to my heart. Its vast world, varying biomes, and unforgiving bosses are much like Re-Logic's own. Core Keeper, a more recent indie title giving [<u>Minecraft meets Stardew Valley</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/minecraft-meets-stardew-valley-in-the-excellent-survival-game-core-keeper-and-its-huge-10-launch-makes-its-creator-feel-he-must-be-dreaming/) vibes, also came to mind given its similar base-building mechanics and overall aesthetic.

Once I hopped into the demo myself, I quickly discovered that Tinkerlands does resemble both of these games in some ways, but it's also so much more. It's a fun package of procedurally generated goodness, potential co-op chaos, and exploration galore. After playing for a short while, I can also safely say that I'm particularly obsessed with the base-building part of Endless Coffee's debut title.

You don't just build your own home. In Tinkerlands, you're tasked with building an entire little thriving town and establishing a diverse community open to new residents who can join and eventually assist you as you adventure. It's sort of like how the NPCs in Terraria work, but a bit more fleshed out - they're not just simple shopkeepers. The pixel art style makes decor feel all the more cozy, too - I just wish I could've rotated furniture.

Outside the base-building, there's a massive world to wander, with unique drops to find and enemies to take on. This is where the more RPG-y side of the game comes into play, and it fits seamlessly in between the crafting and survival-aligned features. There are plenty of formidable bosses to challenge while journeying, too, in proper Terraria fashion. I'm talking giant frogs, creepy-crawly spiders, and royal slimes.

How you handle them is up to you, but I'm personally partial to magic in games like these so I tend to stick with longer-range weapons like staffs. No matter what you choose, though, I'd wager you'll enjoy yourself. I'd recommend giving the [<u>demo</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3185760/Tinkerlands_Demo/) a go during [<u>Valve</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s seasonal [Steam Next Fest](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/steam-next-fest/), with or without some pals in co-op. Hopefully, Tinkerlands evolves even more and I see the two things I'm most hopeful for one day: mounts and pets.
