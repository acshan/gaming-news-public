If the excellent [Fallout TV show](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-tv-show-season-one-amazon-prime-video-release-date-cast-trailer-story-setting-guide/) is inspiring you to pick one of the games back up for a replay, Bethesda is offering a very nice incentive to get back into Fallout 4 with a free next-gen update set to land on April 25.

On PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, the update will make Fallout 4 a native app for those consoles, introducing performance and quality mode settings that will offer "up to 60 FPS and increased resolutions," according to the [official announcement](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s2bXQEbpcrsdCZhUYLHAi/fallout-4-is-getting-free-updates?linkId=100000254670482). You technically *could* play Fallout 4 at 60 FPS on a console thanks to the [current Xbox's FPS boost feature](https://www.gamesradar.com/skyrim-fallout-4-fallout-76-and-more-are-getting-the-xbox-series-x-fps-boost-treatment/), but hopefully official support will offer more options.

If you're still playing on an old-gen console, the update will instead bring "stability improvements, login, and quest fixes." Over on PC, the update will provide "widescreen and ultra-widescreen support, as well as fixes to Creation Kit and a variety of quest updates." Bethesda says the game will also be Steam Deck verified as of this update.

Besides the platform-specific improvements, the update is also bringing a host of free Creation Club items. The most notable of these seems to be the Enclave Remnants pack, which includes a new quest called Echoes of the Past, where you attempt to "stop The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth." The Creation Club add-ons also include a pile of Halloween decorations and a deadly piggy bank launcher, which I always love to see.

This big [next-gen update had previously been scheduled to launch sometime in 2023](https://www.gamesradar.com/bethesda-delays-fallout-4s-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-upgrade-to-2024/), but Bethesda announced a delay back in December, saying "we need a bit more time." Clearly, there's no better time than to coincide with the launch of a major new TV show, and there have [already been updates to other Fallout games with some television crossovers](https://www.gamesradar.com/fan-favorite-fallout-tv-show-characters-are-already-appearing-in-other-fallout-games/).
