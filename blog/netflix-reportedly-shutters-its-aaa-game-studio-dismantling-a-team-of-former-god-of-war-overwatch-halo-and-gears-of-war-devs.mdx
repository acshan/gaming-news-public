Netflix has reportedly shut down its AAA game studio, despite recruiting a strong team of notable veteran developers with experience on God of War, Halo, and more over the last couple of years.

That's according to a [<u>new report from Game File</u>](https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio), which says that the studio – known as Team Blue – appeared to be pursuing some ambitious, multi-device and big-budget stuff behind the scenes. This would have been fuelled by a team full of experienced people, including former Overwatch executive producer Chacko Sonny, and Joseph Staten, the creative director of Halo 3: ODST at [Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bungie/) as well as the head of creative for Halo Infinite at [343 Industries](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/343-industries/).

Those two weren't the only veterans with big games to their names, as studio art director Rafael Grassetti was also [<u>God of War Ragnarok</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-guide/)'s art director, as well as a senior character artist for Mass Effect 3 and Dragon Age 3. That's not to mention Jerry Edsall, the Netflix studio's director of technology, who served as the lead programmer on Gears of War 5 and lead campaign engineer on Gears of War 4 at The Coalition, and studio design director Gavin Irby, was previously campaign design lead at Bungie for [<u>Destiny 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/destiny-2/) and the lead ecology designer for [<u>Overwatch 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/overwatch-2-guide/) at Blizzard.

Game File reports that Netflix declined to confirm how many people have been affected by Team Blue's closure, but a representative apparently revealed that Sonny, Staten, and Grassetti are gone – it's not clear if they were directly impacted by layoffs, or if they left the studio by their own volition. [<u>Edsall's LinkedIn</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerry-edsall/?originalSubdomain=ca) also notably states that he's "ex-Netflix." 

[<u><em>Resident Evil creator thought the studio he helped form "would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games," but Microsoft shut it down anyway.</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/resident-evil-creator-thought-the-studio-he-helped-form-would-be-safe-as-long-as-they-continued-to-make-hi-fi-rush-games-but-microsoft-shut-it-down-anyway/)
