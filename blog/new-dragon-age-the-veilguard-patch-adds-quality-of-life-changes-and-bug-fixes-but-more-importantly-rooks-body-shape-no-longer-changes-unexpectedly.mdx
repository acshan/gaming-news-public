[BioWare](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bioware/) has released patch notes for [Dragon Age: The Veilguard](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-veilguard-guide/) Patch 3, and with how chuckle-inducing and silly they are, you'd almost think you were reading Baldur's Gate 3 patch notes.

EA says the patch includes "multiple quality of life changes and many bug fixes," and indeed, there are a handful of updates that should make life in Thedas just a little bit easier. For folks on PC, "arrow keys can now be bound to input mappings," and for everyone else, filters have been added to photo mode, "it is now easier to identify where an Enchantment has been applied to a companion’s equipment," and "new rings can now be compared against both equipped ring slots."

By far the most amusing lines of Patch 3 are hidden amongst a laundry list of bug fixes. You can read the full notes [here](https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-3-release-notes), but I'd like to quickly highlight a few that made me literal LOL:

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is something of a comeback moment for BioWare and EA, launching on Halloween to largely glowing reviews following much less positively received releases like Anthem and Mass Effect Andromeda. [BioWare creative director John Epler recently stressed the studio's ambition for Dragon Age: The Veilguard to return to the studio's "very real strength" of character-building and storytelling and admitted its other recent projects "didn't center that strength as well as they could have."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says-chasing-industry-trends-with-mass-effect-andromeda-and-anthem-starts-to-dilute-your-focus-so-he-wanted-to-get-back-to-biowares-very-real-strength/)
