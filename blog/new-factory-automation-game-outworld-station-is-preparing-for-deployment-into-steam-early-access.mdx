I think we all dreamed about wanting to make a new life for ourselves in outer space at one time or another. Outworld Station is set to provide a new twist on that fantasy, a new strategy game from the developers at Trickjump Games – the studio behind ArcRunner and Battle Royale Trainer. Here you'll be able to take the helm as a station commander, working to amass resources and construct massive starships while mitigating the harsh realities of the galaxy. 

In this weird alien star system you'll have more to worry about than a few rogue asteroids, but the thought of seeing all your hard work decimated in a flash is certainly enough of a threat to make me get serious about starship construction. Outworld Station is designed to scale up massively in complexity, using increasingly advanced manufacturing to keep your empire expanding. This factory automation game looks exceptionally fun, and I'm keen to learn more about it. 

The latest showing at the Golden Joystick Awards revealed more of the single-player functionality of the experience, although Trickjump Games promises that four-player co-op is coming later down the line. For now, the focus is on getting Outworld Station ready for imminent deployment in Steam early access.
