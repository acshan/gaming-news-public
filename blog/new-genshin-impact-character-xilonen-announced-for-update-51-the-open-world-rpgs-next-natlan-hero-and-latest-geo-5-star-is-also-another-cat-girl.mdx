Genshin Impact update 5.0 and the open-world RPG's new Natlan region are due August 28, or late August 27 for much of the world, and now we know how update 5.1 will follow it up. After Mualani and Kinich in 5.0, Genshin's next 5-star character will be Xilonen, the Geo cat-girl first teased in [an earlier Natlan trailer](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/genshin-impact-drops-a-massive-update-50-teaser-out-of-nowhere-9-natlan-characters-revealed-for-the-rpg-including-the-apparent-pyro-archon/). 

The official Genshin Impact social media accounts announced Xilonen earlier today, right on cue as patch 4.8 winds down and brings the Fontaine arc to a close. Developer HoYoverse typically reveals upcoming characters in batches, but Xilonen is the only 5.1 character at the time of writing. 

Genshin has never released an X.1 patch without a new 5-star, in no small part to maintain the momentum (and revenue) of a region-sized expansion, so we can safely assume Xilonen will be a 5-star character. This would make Xilonen the first Geo 5-star since Chiori, and the second Geo character of Natlan alongside the free 4-star Kachina, who'll be available in update 5.0. Her weapon type and play style remain unknown.

"Xilonen's skill with the forge is renowned throughout Natlan," a lore blurb reads, praising the leopard-tailed girl's work as a blacksmith. "Many come from far and wide to pay homage to her superb skill. Some hope to commission her to forge them weapons, while others only seek to see the visage of this great smith, such that they might have information of great interest to talk about."

Odds are good Xilonen will be playable in the first half of update 5.1, which should arrive on October 7/8, meaning [Xbox players finally getting access to Genshin Impact](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/genshin-impact-is-somehow-coming-to-xbox-before-switch-over-4-years-after-it-was-announced-for-nintendos-console-with-a-dollar10-bundle-nobody-should-buy/) will just miss her.
