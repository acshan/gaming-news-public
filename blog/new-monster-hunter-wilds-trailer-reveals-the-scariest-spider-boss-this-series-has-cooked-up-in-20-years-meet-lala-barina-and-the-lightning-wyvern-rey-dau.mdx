[Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) brought a new [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) trailer to [<u>Gamescom Opening Night Live</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gamescom-opening-night-live-live-coverage-2024-everything-announced/), and it's equal parts dreamy and nightmarish thanks to a new spider that makes every previous insect boss look tame. We also got a much better look at the apex predator of the new Windward Plains, the lightning wyvern Rey Dau.

Our new spider overlord, Lala Barina, looks to be the third Temnoceran-type large monster, following Monster Hunter 4's Nerscylla and Rakna-Kadaki of Monster Hunter Rise, both of which have souped-up variants. This rose-like creepy-crawly weaves a nest of red fibers and attacks with a mix of airborne webbing, clawed forelegs, and a retractable stinger on its abdomen. The featured environment is listed as the Scarlet Forest, home to Lala Barina's nest. I'm already hoping there's a blue rose variant of this thing. 

Lala Barina is an agile, almost balletic opponent, but the other new monster shown today packs a bit more brute strength. Rey Dau looks to be a flying wyvern similar to Seregios, but instead of sharpened scales it uses its sheer heft and railgun-like lightning bolts to attack. Rey Dau was previously described as a major player in the story, and the ominous setup of today's trailer lines up with that. 

Cutting through the arachnophobia, the trailer ends with a brief look at our hunter's new cooking animation. This series really has come a long way: now we can cook up six steaks in one massive rack. That's progress, folks. 

*Monster Hunter Wilds is still penciled in for a 2025 release date, *[<u><em>and all signs point to that being early in the year</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-fuels-hopes-for-monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-very-early-2025-by-giving-it-the-same-video-treatment-monster-hunter-world-got-6-months-before-its-launch/)*. *
