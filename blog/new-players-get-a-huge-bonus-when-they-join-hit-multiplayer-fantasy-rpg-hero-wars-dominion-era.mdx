Multiplayer fantasy RPG Hero Wars: Dominion Era is handing out huge bonuses to new players, making this the perfect time to dive in, so simply head to the [<u>official Hero Wars website</u>](https://nexters.g2afse.com/click?pid=1156&offer_id=116&sub1=gamesradar&sub8=%7Bclick_id) to sign up and claim your rewards.

Hero Wars: Dominion Era tasks you with assembling a team of Heroes to battle on your behalf in both PvE and PvP battles. Once you've begun putting your team together, you can head to the Campaign to get to grips with the basics of the game, earning rewards that will help strengthen the characters you're fighting alongside. As your team gets stronger, you'll unlock more modes; a PvP Arena where you can take on other players; a Tower where you can undertake a daily excursion to farm gold; the Outland, where you'll take on powerful bosses using specific strategies.

As you take part in these adventures, you'll earn rewards that make your Heroes even more powerful, eventually becoming powerful enough to join a Guild and go on Adventures with your new allies, taking part in fights in the Grand Arena, Elemental Tournaments, and more. The more you play, the more you'll unlock, and the more powerful you can become.

With all those game modes at your disposal, you'll need to put your Heroes to work in combat. Each Hero has four skills - three of which activate automatically as they fight enemies in combat, and a fourth, ultimate skill that you, the player, must activate. By using different combinations of Heroes, Titans, and Pets, it's up to you to create the most powerful team possible to pit against both enemy players and the monsters of [Hero Wars: Dominion Era](https://nexters.g2afse.com/click?pid=1156&offer_id=116&sub1=gamesradar&sub8=%7Bclick_id). Thankfully, you've got plenty of options to choose from thanks to the game's huge roster; Tanks soak up enemy damage; Warriors get up-close to deal damage; Healers help keep your team alive, and Marksman and Mage characters deal damage from afar. Special characters offer alternative traits and can bring even more strength to your team, so look out for them.

If you're looking to get your start in Hero Wars: Dominion Era, you can get a huge boost thanks to an ongoing bonus for new players.
