Nikoderiko: The Magical World just got announced at the [Future Games Show Summer Showcase](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/).

Developer VEA Games has absolutely nailed the cartoon-esque platformer vibe that channels the likes of Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot. It's even got David Wise on board for the musical score, whose previous work includes Donkey Kong Country and Battletoads. 

But, here, you're playing as a mongoose called Nikoderiko - as the game's name suggests - going up against an evil snake named Zarus and his gremlin-like minions to find some treasure. 

As you explore the magical worlds alluded to by the title, Nikoderiko has all sorts of moves he can use to take out the foes he finds there. In this side-scrolling adventure, he can slide, jump, spin and ground pound, as well picking up items to lob at his enemies. 

However, he can also befriend some animal folks that he can ride, like warthogs, giant pink toads, and oversized seahorses, which also give you even more abilities like smashing down walls and better traversing underwater realms. 

What's extra fun about Nikoderiko is that you can also play in co-op with a friend taking on the role of a female mongoose called Luna. 

From the looks of some of the boss battles shown off in the Future Games Show trailer, you may well want a pal by your side as these gators are *not* messing around. 

Nikoderiko: The Magical World is coming later this year on PS5, PC, Xbox Series X and S, and Nintendo Switch.
