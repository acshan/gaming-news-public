[<u>Tears of the Kingdom</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/) may just be the biggest [<u>Legend of Zelda</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-legend-of-zelda/) game to date - so big, in fact, that [<u>Nintendo</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/nintendo/) made its own social media platform for developers to help speed up production.

During Japanâ€™s Computer Entertainment Development Conference, Tears of the Kingdom director Hidemaro Fujibayashi and engineer Kenichi Hirose went behind the scenes with an in-depth look at the open-world Zelda sequel's development. As reported by [<u>Automaton</u>](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-had-its-own-internal-social-media-to-streamline-the-massive-workload-during-tears-of-the-kingdoms-development/), the team made quite an effort to help better streamline devs' work and improve communication between them - so much so, that they created an in-house social platform.

Much like Facebook or even Reddit, this platform served to promote discussion and sharing between its users - the Tears of the Kingdom devs. Dubbed the "Rupee Bulletin Board" in honor of the Zelda series' iconic gem-like currency, it sounds like Nintendo's homemade social media site did everything it was supposed to do - devs could post feedback regarding playtests in real-time so that the rest of the team could easily keep track of everything.



The platform even had its own unique "like" or "upvote" system - devs could give each other "Rupees" if they agreed with something. This served as a useful priority system and made it much easier for Nintendo to summarize any data. The Rupee Bulletin Board came equipped with a set of rules, too - devs wanted posts to be objective, with opinions solidified only by facts rather than any personal or subjectively formed impressions.

Nintendo also maintained a strict "no-argument rule" - any feedback would've needed to be given constructively via posts and, of course, Rupees. As a Zelda stan myself, I love learning unexpected facts about the devs like the creation of the Rupee Bulletin Board - it'd be fun to see a fan-driven forum of sorts with similar systems in place, like Rupees instead of likes. I'll leave that to the professionals, though.
