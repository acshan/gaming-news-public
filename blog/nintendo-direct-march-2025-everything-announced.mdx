And away we go! We've got a few hours to go until the Nintendo Direct kicks off good and proper, but we're kicking things off by rounding up all the rumors and chatter right here so you don't have to travel far to find it.

Wee reminder for those who need it, today's Nintendo Direct is due to begin at 7am PT / 10am ET / 2pm GMT. We're only going for 30 minutes so it ought to be fairly breezy, but make sure you turn up 5 minutes early so you don't miss a thing.

That said, we're covering all the big news, so maybe do turn up late if you really want to. Who am I to get in the way of your plans?

So, a big question to start: Why are we here? As much as we all enjoy a Nintendo Direct, do we need this one with the Switch 2-focused direct just next week?

According to two former Nintendo marketing leads, it's certainly an odd play that may underline the pressure Ninty is currently feeling. The OG Switch is one of the most popular consoles out there and still has games to market, but, of course, we now need to transition to the next big piece of hardware.

Naturally, no one can say for sure what's going on at Nintendo HQ, but I do encourage you to watch the full video above.

What say you? For myself, a Direct certainly makes some sense as we're still likely a few months from a possible Switch 2 release, and there'll be plenty of games to release and market in the meantime; Pokemon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond being just two of them.

Who knows. Maybe today is the day that Hollow Knight: Silksong fans finally get a crumb or two. The MIA Metroidvania got an [<em>unprecedented </em>two Steam updates](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hollow-knight-silksong-gets-unprecedented-second-update-in-2-weeks-with-a-steam-page-tweak-pointing-to-a-2025-release/) within two weeks lately, and [Xbox hasn't given up hope](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/6-years-and-1-prolonged-delay-later-xbox-is-still-calling-incredible-hollow-knight-silksong-one-of-its-upcoming-games/) either. Me? I wouldn't put that clown makeup away just yet . . .

Elsewhere, [fans](https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-has-retweeted-the-nintendo-direct.1145961/) are [having fun](https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1905063799477940673) with the fact that Smash Bros. and Kirby favorite Masahiro Sakurai has retweeted news of today's direct with a simple message.

It could be something; it could be nothing. Regardless, folks are enjoying it, so I'll allow it.

One such person also enjoying Sakurai's Tweet is Smash Bros. pro [HungryBox](https://xcancel.com/LiquidHbox/status/1905093532353782058), who says we're definitely, totally getting Ultimate Deluxe. Hmm.

As a slightly more serious pitch - I can do those, sometimes - I wonder if we might get another look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond today. The long-awaited game is due to release this year, so it's about that time, you'd think.

One hour to go, team! Take this as your opportunity to get some snacks, hydrate, and all that good stuff.

In the immortal words of All Might, I (US Managing Editor Rollin Bishop) am here! With just over half an hour to go, that means in about an hour's time we will have all collectively seen what, exactly, compelled Nintendo to have a standalone Nintendo Direct the week before one focused on the Switch 2. That's right; I know math.

15 minutes to go, folks! This is not a drill. Final notice to hit the bathroom, grab a drink, and generally get cozy. And for me, personally, it's time for that second cup of coffee.

We are less than 5 minutes out now! Nearly time! This is the space to put out into the world all of those wants and wishes that might never come true. For me? As always, I would love to see Sega announce a remaster of Valkyria Chronicles 2 or 3 â€“ or both!

And here we go!

Dragon Quest up first, looks like? But those are already out... right?

Oh wow! OK, yes, I was right, but not *this *one. This is Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD Remake. But there's "another character" at the end. More info to come in the future. Game still looks great.

A new entry from the AI: The Somnium files! No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files. Good name.

Conduct interviews, dive into drives, solve puzzles. You know, the usual. Uncover what's hidden on July 25, 2025 for Nintendo Switch.

Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army! A classic Atlus RPG coming back for the Switch; you love to see it. Summon demons, take on enemies. You get the idea.



Preorders today, out on June 19, 2025. Look at him up there.

Shadow Labyrinth (that dark Pac-Man game) is back. Looks a bit like a platforming Metroidvania? Progression with abilities to enhance, resources to gather, uncovering the goal of "Puck" while devouring enemies. All right then.

Launches July 18, 2025.

Patapon 1+2 Replay! Drum to the beat once more with remastered versions of the PSP classics. Honestly, this has maybe made this entire Nintendo Direct worthwhile to me, and I suspect I'm not alone. Launches on Nintendo Switch July 11, 2025.

Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar from the Nintendo DS (or so the Direct claims; I missed it on that platform despite my love for it) is back for the Nintendo Switch. Get to know locals, nurture relationships, glide around, farm. You know, the usual stuff. Out August 27, 2025 for the Nintendo Switch.

And we immediately shift to a jungle of some kind... Holy cow, it's actually Metroid Prime 4: Beyond!

*points at Samus *There's Samus.

Planet Viewros shown, jungle planet with colossal tree. Has to survive and escape, scan and translate relics to carve a path forward. Sold. You got it.

There are, of course, critters "waiting to strike" because this is a Metroid Prime game. Gotta shoot 'em. But Samus is granted powers, and specifically psychic abilities in order to operate mechanisms, open doors, and shift the trajectory of her beams "with the power of her mind." OK. All right.

"What will be here fate after being summoned to Viewros?" I don't know, man, you tell me! Game still coming 2025, but no definitive date or season given. I want to believe.

"It looks like even more challenges await Samus!" Sure does, bud. Sure does.

Here's a game about mixing drinks for Disney characters. Sure. Pokemon Cafe is popular, right? There's apparently a bunch of different outcomes? Disney Villains Cursed Cafe launches today, so not long to wait.

Witchbrook! It's been 10,000 years...

Pixel art looks great here still. "Stardew Magical Academy" is really compelling, and it looks great. Co-op with up to four players. Available Holiday 2025.

The Eternal Life of Goldman is a hand-drawn platformer exploring a place where nightmares and wonders collide. OK. Uncover the secrets, because there's always secrets, this holiday.

Gradius Origins! Love me some Gradius. Apparently there's a new one included too? You didn't have to. Pre-orders later today on Nintendo eShop.

Rift of the Necrodancer! Rhythm game spinoff launches today. Plus DLC tease; was that Pizza Tower?

No time to dwell! Now it's Tamagotchi Plaza, which looks like an Animal Crossing-style game where you help out various shops. Maybe more about shopping, but has over 100 new and class Tamagotchi. Launches on Nintendo Switch June 27, 2025.

Pokemon in a traditional Nintendo Direct?? What are we doing here??? A wild Pokemon Legends Z-A has appeared.

Just a look at the various people and Pokemon of the Lumiose City setting. Wild zone gameplay shown now. That Krokorok looks mad, y'all.

Apparently there's a tournament at night, the Z-A Royale, where trainers await in battle zones where trainers will challenge you if they catch you. But you can land a surprise attack by hitting them first. And, of course, Mega Evolution is back as we know. Start at Rank Z, work up to Rank A, where trainers "are said to have a wish granted." Cool, I love to have wishes granted.

Pokemon Legends Z-A launches "later this year," which we already know. The day and night cycle changes appear to be the real new details.

I have no idea what I'm looking at here. Just being honest. But I like that the character on screen keeps saying "boop." Looks like a strange, minigame-laden title? Rhythm-based doodad?

Oh yeah, there's a beat now. Jumping little dudes through a ring and they sing out a note. I don't even need to know any more. Oh! Rhythm Heaven Groove. I should have known. All the clues were there, Mr. Policeman. Coming 2026.

"We hope you're looking forward to it!" I am, my dude. I am.

Virtual Game Cards being introduced... A method of continuing to play games. I'm struggling to understand how this really differs from the current system at first blush.

Oh, OK, here we go. You can lend these virtual game cards out to people in a family membership, for example, which is slightly better than the current digital game system that Nintendo uses. You can loan for two weeks, 14 days total. You use an interface to manage and "insert" and "swap" them around. Honestly, might need to see in action.

But! Can also be done with Nintendo Switch 2, apparently? Coming in a late April update.

And now: montage time! High on Life, Star Overdrive, The Wandering Village, King of Meat, Lou's Lagoon, and Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time.

Montage done! An HD remaster of Saga Frontier 2 is coming to Nintendo Switch. Lord have mercy, these graphics hit me right in the nostalgia. This is what my memory of these kinds of games look like even if they actually didn't at the time. Lovely backgrounds, fascinating gameplay. Launches today! Wow.

Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 are launching on Nintendo Switch April 15, 2025! Good stuff. If you've not played, you're in for a treat. And Monument Valley 3 is coming this summer.

A new Everybody's Golf! What a world. Everybody's Golf Hot Shots. A good day for old PlayStation franchises coming to Nintendo Switch in one way or another. Available 2025, looks like cartoonish golf which... OK.

Marvel Cosmic Invasion! Pair two heroes from a roster of 15 in what looks to be a beat-'em-up of sorts inspired by classic arcade game. Up to 4 players for online or local co-op! Launches this holiday.

Last announcement coming now...

Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream. Coming 2026. And now there's a giant person running at a much smaller person? I don't... what is... All right. First new entry in the series in over a decade. Mii characters living on an island out at sea having various interactions. So, New Horizons, but Tomodachi?

There's one more announcement (that's not a game) from Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo Direct still happening going forward, but also there's a new Nintendo app called Nintendo Today! with various news, updates, and content.

A dedicated Nintendo app... Nintendo Switch 2 news will be coming daily, directly, following the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2. Don't mind me; just gonna existentially stare into middle distance for a bit.

...and that's all, folks! Nintendo Direct over. Kind of a headscratcher in the end as to why this was strictly necessary ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct, but it ain't like I'm mad at all the announcements. Roughly half of what I saw there I'm immediately excited for so that's all well and good in my book.
