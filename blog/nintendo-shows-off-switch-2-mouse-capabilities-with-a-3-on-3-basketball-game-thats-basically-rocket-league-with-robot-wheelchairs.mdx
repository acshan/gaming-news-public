You can indeed use the [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) [Joy-Con as a mouse](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-confirms-that-nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-will-have-mouse-controls-built-in/), and Nintendo has a Rocket League-style sports game featuring robot characters in wheel-chair-like vehicles to fully demonstrate the possibilities.

Drag x Drive is a three-on-three basketball title. The gimmick is that you use a pair of mouse Joy-Con to wheel yourself forward around skatepark-like levels to get your ball into the basket. It's set to launch this summer.

The trick to movement is you have to use both the [Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) Joy-Con like they're computer mice, and you need to slide them back and forth as if you were moving the wheels of you chair yourself - slide them both forward to go straight, in opposite directions to turn left and right. You even have to raise and flick the Joy-Cons to shoot.

There's no mousemat shown in the trailer, so hopefully this means the Joy-Con will work on any surface.

You can also wave the Joy-Con to signal to your teammates that you're open for a pass, which is a nice way to implement the technology. There are plenty of sick tricks you can pull off in Drag x Drive that earn you more points, so maybe each will need a different combination of hand movements to do.

Although Drag x Drive isn't a [launch title](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games/), [Mario Kart World](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/mario-kart-world-takes-the-racing-series-open-world-and-it-launches-day-one-exclusively-on-switch-2/) and [Welcome Tour](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-with-welcome-tour-nintendos-answer-to-astros-playroom-but-youll-have-to-pay-for-it/) are, and you can check out all the other [upcoming Switch 2 games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-switch-2-games/) in our handy roundup.
