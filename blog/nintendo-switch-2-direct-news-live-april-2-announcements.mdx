> Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct revealed a June 5th release date,  4K resolution, improved backwards compatibility, and new games like Mario Kart World and a Survival Kids revival.  The console will cost $449.99.

Turns out that while the stream was frozen, we all missed the [reveal of a revival for Survival Kids](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/the-switch-2-direct-broke-just-in-time-for-me-to-nearly-miss-a-revival-of-a-26-year-old-konami-cult-classic-i-obsessed-over-in-nintendo-power/), a decades-old Konami cult classic that was basically a survival game before survival games were cool. Now it's back with a new aesthetic exclusively on Switch 2.

You don't think you're off the hook yet, do you? The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct might be over, but there are still *7 more hours *of Nintendo Switch 2 footage to get through with [Nintendo Treehouse streams starting tomorrow](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-is-just-the-start-7-hours-of-switch-2-gameplay-is-coming-this-week-in-nintendo-treehouse-streams/).

While the Nintendo Switch 2 will cost $450 on its own, and the partially open world zoom-fest Mario Kart World will be priced at $80, the [Switch 2 bundle](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/switch-2-bundle-will-include-a-digital-version-of-mario-kart-world-nintendos-first-open-world-racer/) with a digital version of the racer will be $499. Yay?

Nintendo has more in common with players than we thought – the company once "[wished the Switch system's processor was faster](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-admits-there-were-times-when-we-wished-the-switch-systems-processor-was-faster-so-that-developers-could-make-any-kind-of-game-they-wanted/)" so that developers had more space to experiment.

The Switch 2 will offer [up to 4k resolution](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-will-offer-4k-resolution-when-hooked-up-to-tv-making-it-nintendos-most-powerful-console-yet/) in its TV mode. Sure, the PS4 Pro did it first in 2016, but after Nintendo fans have waited so long to escape the original Switch's 30fps dungeon, this upgrade feels huge.

Switch 2 doesn't have any Switch 1 hardware inside, which means [its backwards compatibility won't be quite as all-encompassing as what we saw on 3DS and Wii U.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/switch-2-plays-switch-1-games-through-something-in-between-a-software-emulator-and-hardware-compatibility-so-dont-expect-the-same-backward-compatibility-we-got-on-3ds-and-wii-u/) The system instead uses "something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility" to run old games.



Any thoughts on the new Nintendo Switch 2 controller? Nintendo is promising big thing as it says it wants to create "the pinnacle of all controllers". [You can check out our full story here for more deets.](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-has-a-long-running-project-to-create-the-pinnacle-of-all-controllers-and-its-not-the-switch-2-but-the-switch-2-pro-comes-close/)

Nintendo also says it wants the [Switch 2 to "stand the test of time" ](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-wants-the-switch-2-to-stand-the-test-of-time-which-is-something-that-the-original-switch-hasnt-really-managed/)and not feel "outdated" later on, as some might feel with the OG Switch.

"Because Switch has been accepted by many players and played over a long period of time, in the same way, we wanted Switch 2 to be a dedicated game system with performance that can stand the test of time," Takuhiro Dohta says.

"We carefully considered the balance between processing capability and system memory capacity, and we believe we've managed to create a system that players won't feel is outdated later down the line."

Right, now that the dust has settled on the big Switch 2 Direct, we're getting some comments from the console developers themselves. Here's a tidbit: [Nintendo nearly called the Switch 2 the "Super Nintendo Switch"](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-nearly-called-the-switch-2-the-super-nintendo-switch-as-a-throwback-to-the-nes-but-it-didnt-feel-right/) as a throwback to the NES, but "it didn't feel right."

The things we lost.

It looks like we might have a Nintendo Switch 2 price after all. According to a [press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250402229347/en/Nintendo-Switch-2-Launches-June-5-at-%24449.99-Bringing-New-Forms-of-Game-Communication-to-Life) on Business Wire, the "Nintendo Switch 2 system arrives June 5 for a suggested retail price of $449.99."

And there you have it! How we feeling team?

Donkey Kong: Bananza, to offer its real name. This one releases July 17, 2025.

Monkecraft.

It is! The boy is back.

Last game up now, and it looks like Donkey Kong.

Kirby Air Riders! A new game from none other than Sakurai himself.

It's Kirby! What you doin', buddy?

It's not Bloodborne 2, but I'm calling it Bloodborne 2 anyway.

The Duskbloods! A Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive that's due to land next year.

That certainly is a FromSoftware frog.

Ooooh, new FromSoftware game is up!

We're all eating rather well today, aren't we?

Also a reminder that Hollow Knight: Silksong is still real and is targeting a 2025 release.

Cyberpunk 2077 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake are coming to Switch 2! Nintendo clearly trying to offer what the Steam Deck can manage, and I'm here for it.

The video is now unfrozen, but things are still a tad funky and clearly not totally aligned.

Can still hear the news, though. Sounds exciting enough!

Uh, the video appears to be frozen for everyone. Sit tight, gang.

And Borderlands 4. That'll be coming to Switch 2 at some point this year when the loot 'em up is ready to go.

Back to the modern day, Deltarune chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 are coming to Switch 2! All available when the Switch 2 launches.

We're also getting a Gamecube controller with the Switch 2's fancy 'C' button, which I imagine will be fantastic news for Smash Bros. fans.

More games like Pokemon XD coming in due course, too.

Zelda: Windwaker or Soulcalibur 2? Oh, go on then.

Throwing it back to the gems, we've just found out that Gamecube is coming to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.

New game reveal! There is indeed a Zelda reveal. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment tells the tale of the events that came before Tears of the Kingdom.

There's a highlight. Bravely Default! Oh, and Project 007 from the Hitman devs, I suppose.

There's plenty more, too. From previous gems like Split Fiction to upcoming games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4.

Hades 2 also confirmed! I got through so much Hades on the Switch I can't help but be delighted.

Oh dang! If you want an idea of how powerful the Switch 2 is, we're getting Elden Ring.

Nintendo also confirms that, if you own a game on Switch already, you can pay to upgrade it to the enhanced Switch 2 version.

It's not just old games, either. Metroid Prime 4 Beyond and Pokemon Legends: Z-A are also getting enhanced.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land! Now we're cookin'

What games are getting enhanced? Why, only The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.

Nintendo Switch 2 Enhanced games have also been confirmed. While the Switch 2 comes with backward compatibility, some games will get a spruce up for the Switch 2.

Release date! The Nintendo Switch 2 releases June 5.

Game cards confirmed! They look as they do on the Switch, but they're red now.

Well, there's another game for you. Welcome Tour is an Astro Bot-looking game that shows you how the Switch 2 works. That's one way to replace the manual.

Heck yeah - the Nintendo Switch 2 has eight times the storage of a Switch 1. That means 256gb internal storage.

Some technical details now. The Switch 2 has double the pixels of its predecessor, can hit 120fps, and, basically, everything is bigger when it comes to buttons. Oh! And the Joy-Con can indeed be used as a mouse, conforming a lot of rumors and speculation.

Oooh, we're getting something called GameShare. Basically, you can stream certain games to other consoles for a limited time.

Mind you, if you get the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, you can even bring some face time to a party. Proper pandemic vibes there.

Some might say that Nintendo is a tad late to the party with this one, but hey! Better late than never.

It's not just the one game, either. You can kick off a group chat to speak with pals even if everyone is playing different games.

'C' button explanation confirmed! It is, indeed, a chat function. Unlike the OG Switch, you won't need to download a mobile app to yap with pals.

Interestingly, Nintendo says the Mario Kart World release date is the same as the Switch 2, but doesn't say what that is. I suspect we'll have to wait for that detail.

That's it for Mario Kart World, but we'll be getting a special MK Direct on April 17.

Mario Kart World encouraging us to take a scenic route and snap a picture with pals is the energy I'm here for.

Ah, there's a detail. You can literally drive anywhere you like in this one. Where we're goin', we don't need roads. Unless you'd like roads.

In fairness, Mario Kart rarely sticks to numbers, so it comes as little surprise.

We've got a name! Mario Kart World is the next game in the series, rather than something like MK9.

DK looking a lot like he does in the Mario film, it must be said. Why not, eh.

Looks like we're starting with some good ol' Mario Kart.

And here we go!

The 60 second timer is here! Shuffle on in, gang.

This is your 15 minute warning. It's all happening!

Speaking of coffee, I'm handing this live coverage back over to Iain Harris for the main event. Catch you all on the other side (and remember, there's still time to manifest a new Boktai: The Sun is in your Hands sequel).

This is your 20 minute warning. If you're tuning in from the USA, good morning – I know it's early, but there's still time to grab yourself a little coffee. For those of you in the UK and Europe, I hope you've found a suitable enough excuse to avoid work and/or school this afternoon.



The Switch 2 Direct YouTube page is whirring into action, and folks are getting excited by the fact that the presentation can be viewed in 4K. Does this mean that the Switch 2 will have 4K support while docked as some rumors this week have suggested? I don't know about all that, but there's no harm in a little last minute speculation now, is there?

Xbox has made no secret of its interest in fostering a closer relationship with Nintendo. We're living in a world where Xbox Game Studios has largely removed itself from the exclusives-business – Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are due to land on PS5 this month – so it's easy to imagine a world where Xbox puts a strong Nintendo collaboration forward from the jump.



When Nintendo revealed the original Nintendo Switch, it used The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim to help promote the power of its handheld hybrid.

I can see a world in which Nintendo leans on partnerships with the likes of FromSoftware, Ubisoft, Xbox, and others to showcase key hardware improvements.

In fact, there's a lot of noise this week of Halo: The Master Chief Collection being among the Switch 2 game announcements today – albeit in a stripped back fashion. That probably means no multiplayer, which would break my heart, but still, I would quite like to replay through the Halo trilogy again.



The other massive news we are expecting out of this Switch 2 presentation is a release date. There's been chatter for a while now that the console will be out in June, 2025, but hopefully Nintendo will confirm that today.

June is a challenging month, right? How will we fit the Switch 2 in with all the news out of Summer Game Fest, and the release of Death Stranding 2 on June 26? We'll find a way, won't we. What a good problem to have.



I'm personally quite invested in learning more about the Nintendo Switch 2 price. The world is a very different place to how it was in 2017, and I find it difficult to believe that Nintendo will be able to offer a competitive $299 price point again.

For context, here's how the competition stacked up recently:

Josh West here, signing on to let Iain Harris grab a coffee ahead of the Switch 2 Showcase, which is set to begin in little over an hour.

You know, I have covered a lot of Nintendo reveals over the years and they are always a delight. If this is your first one, get ready for some fun (and plenty of weird news).

I certainly am, Doug. I certainly am.

To bring the vibe back on side, here's the Nintendo of America president asking the big questions.

Whatever comes with the Switch 2, it could end up being a bittersweet era for Nintendo. A [pair of former marketing leads say that "everything is about to change"](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/ex-nintendo-pr-managers-say-the-switch-2-generation-is-likely-to-see-the-retirement-of-several-of-the-major-developers-at-nintendo-who-we-have-known-for-40-something-years/) as 40-year veterans like Shigeru Miyamoto will likely near the end of their tenure.

"It may not mean that the games are going to be bad, it's just going to feel different," Kit Ellis says on the Kit & Krysta podcast.

Indeed, alongside the likes of Miyamoto, you've got Metroid veteran Yoshio Sakamoto and Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma above the age of 60, and they are not the only ones. There will be fresh blood waiting in the wings, though the idea of such storied developers calling time is suitably sad. Not to bring the tone down or anything.

As per our [Switch 2 predictions,](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-direct-predictions-games-hardware-april-2025/) Josh reckons it's time for a new 3D Mario game. It has been seven years since Super Mario Odyssey, to be fair, so I reckon he's right. You'd also expect something that shows off the console's gimmick, like we got with Wii Sports, Nintendo Land, and 1-2-Switch.

Anyway, despite our excitement for new buttons and mouse-like Joy-Cons, we do expect to see some games today. Mario Kart feels like a given, but there's likely to be much more. Nintendo recently announced that we're getting [7 hours of Switch 2 gameplay this week through Treehouse streams. ](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-is-just-the-start-7-hours-of-switch-2-gameplay-is-coming-this-week-in-nintendo-treehouse-streams/)

Assuming it's not one big Mario Kart tournament, what would you like to see?

If you thought we were done talking about random Switch 2 console features, you'd be wrong. Another early detail from an FCC filing seemingly points to the [Switch 2 Pro Controller adding a headphone jack.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-switch-2-pro-controller-seemingly-adds-a-headphone-jack-and-thats-such-a-godsend-im-almost-willing-to-forgive-nintendo-for-being-12-years-behind-playstation-and-xbox/)

How big of a deal is that? Well, enough for staff writer Dustin to "forgive Nintendo for being 12 years behind PlayStation and Xbox." Maybe. It's hopefully a day of healing here at GR+ towers.



That's not the only question we're asking going into the Direct, naturally. There be rumors afoot that the [Switch 2 Joy-Con can be used as some sort of mouse](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/new-switch-2-patent-confirms-it-nintendo-is-straight-up-calling-that-joy-con-thing-a-mouse/). That'd be wild if true, but also, truthfully, not unlike Nintendo at all.

One of the big talking points going into this showcase is the mysterious new 'C' button. We've been left to wonder what it might do, with some thinking it could stand for 'community' or 'connection.' Nintendo is clearly aware of the clamor, [posting a tease](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-drops-all-subtlety-and-shoves-the-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-straight-into-our-mortal-eyes-and-at-this-point-i-think-the-c-stands-for-confusion/) on their newly released app just the other day. Thanks, Ninty.

Thankfully, all of our questions will soon be answered. I hope?

One person you should not ask about the Switch 2 Direct is Smash Bros creator Masahiro Sakurai. The fan-favorite developer says he [really doesn't know what will be revealed,](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-is-surprised-the-switch-2-direct-is-an-hour-long-and-no-he-doesnt-know-whats-coming-even-if-people-are-going-to-suspect-no-matter-what/) though he doubts you'll believe him anyway. He's also surprised the whole broadcast is an hour long, though we would point out that the [OG Switch Direct that revealed Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, and more](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/switch-2-direct-will-be-approximately-60-minutes-long-about-the-same-length-as-the-switch-1-presentation-which-revealed-mario-odyssey-splatoon-2-and-more/) was the same amount of time.

Josh's point about third-party games interests me, personally. While [Nintendo had to make up some ground with the Switch](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-nintendo-marketing-leads-say-the-wii-u-flopped-so-bad-that-getting-third-party-support-on-switch-was-really-hard-but-the-switch-2-marks-a-new-era-theres-no-more-proving-yourself/) following the Wii U's less-than-ideal run, former Nintendo marketing leads Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang reckon the Switch 2 could take things to another level.

"A lot of these big studios got a lot of experience and positive feedback through putting their game on the Steam Deck and translating it to a piece of hardware that's maybe not as powerful as the high-end PC that, of course, they would envision that everyone would have that experience with," Ellis [reasons](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/if-it-can-run-on-steam-deck-it-can-probably-run-on-switch-2-ex-nintendo-marketing-leads-say-baldurs-gate-3-and-elden-ring-prove-theres-a-market-for-big-aaa-games-on-switch-2/), "but they saw, 'no wait, there's a lot of people that want to play a version that's maybe a little bit dialed down because they want that extra form factor.

"I'm talking about Baldur's Gate 3. I'm talking about Elden Ring. I'm talking about Cyberpunk. The list goes on ... we don't yet know the complete under-the-hood power of the Switch 2, but it's not crazy to say, 'well, if it can run on a Steam Deck it probably can run on a Switch 2, right?'"

It's a fair pitch. Nintendo consoles often appeal as they home the games you can't play elsewhere, though playing third-party bangers on the Switch ruled - and the Steam Deck indeed built on that. It feels a little unlike Nintendo to double down on third party, though I suppose that's also an argument to do it.

It would be impossible to [predict what Switch 2 announcements we'll get](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-direct-predictions-games-hardware-april-2025/), so we've tried to do just that. From Switch 2 Enhanced games to grander third-party games, we reckon Nintendo is going big by building upon the foundations of the OG Switch. But what do you think?

And because we're *extra* nice, we're also keeping track of any rumors and news surrounding [Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-live/), which many massive retailers are indicating may go live later today.

Also, because we're nice, the YouTube link for the stream itself is included above, so all you have to do is hit play when the time comes. There will likely be a countdown, so don't worry if you're a few minutes late to the stream.

First things first - The [Nintendo Switch 2 Direct time](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-direct-time-how-to-watch/). As per the House of Mario, The showcase is due to begin at 6am PT, 9am ET, 2pm BST, 3pm CEST. This whole thing should last an hour, so make sure you've used stocked up on snacks and used the bathroom.

And away we go! We hope you're ready, as it's going to be a big day, so let's get to yapping.

As Hollow Knight Silksong makes a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reemergence for Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox reminds everyone the Metroidvania is still day one on Game Pass
