The [<u>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/) is finally here, and with it comes a wealth of knowledge regarding the new console from [<u>Nintendo</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/) and a look at some of its upcoming games – including Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment. There's plenty to look forward to when it comes to the [<u>Nintendo Switch 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/), but [<u>Legend of Zelda</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-legend-of-zelda/) fans are eating particularly good thanks to the new Hyrule Warriors. A unique entry in the spin-off Zelda series, Age of Imprisonment sees players step into the titular princess' shoes as well as the Zonai's in the time leading into [<u>Tears of the Kingdom</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-guide/). It features the fast-paced combat of its predecessors, albeit with a heavier focus on the story.

The new Hyrule Warriors is all about the Imprisoning War that serves as part of Tears of the Kingdom's backstory, chronicling the betrayal of Ganondorf, leader of the Gerudo, and the foundation of the [<u>Breath of the Wild</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide/) sequel's Hyrule Kingdom. Age of Imprisonment is set to release sometime this winter, and is being developed by Koei Tecmo "with support from Nintendo" – just like the 2014 original and [<u>Age of Calamity</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/).There's no telling when exactly the game will drop in the winter, but it's coming as a Switch 2 exclusive. If the last spin-off, Age of Calamity, is anything to go off of, Age of Imprisonment might cost at least around $59.99 – but an official price point has not yet been announced by Nintendo. More news on Age of Imprisonment is sure to come soon with the Switch 2 itself releasing on June 5, though.*Searching for more?
