The hype for the Nintendo [<u>Switch 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) is through the roof. Its confirmed June 5 release isn't too far away, and an exciting lineup of launch games has been revealed to boot, with highlights including Mario Kart World and Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition.

Amongst all the other [<u>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct news</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/) unveiled today, we got our first proper look at the [<u>upcoming Switch 2 games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-switch-2-games/) arriving on the console's launch day. Back in 2017, the Switch's big launch game was, of course, [<u>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide/), so the Switch 2's selection always had a lot to live up to.

[<u>Mario Kart World</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mario-kart-world-guide/) was the one thing we could safely predict would show up in the launch lineup given its appearance during the [<u>initial Switch 2 announcement in January</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-is-coming-this-year-with-a-full-nintendo-switch-2-direct-next-month/). At the time, we didn't even know what it was going to be called, which [<u>prompted plenty of debate</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/some-mario-kart-9-fans-are-less-concerned-about-whether-or-not-the-racer-will-be-nintendo-switch-2s-launch-title-than-they-are-about-its-name/) over whether it'd have a numbered title or take on an entirely fresh moniker. Now though, it has an official name, and it'll be racing onto the new console very soon – no doubt it'll be the launch highlight for many.

Here's a full list of every Switch 2 game that'll be launching on the console's release day:

Luckily, this isn't the last we're going to see of these games before their launch. Across April 3 and 4 (that's tomorrow and the day after, if you're reading this article on the day it was published), Nintendo is hosting two Treehouse streams that'll give us a juicy combined total of [<u>seven hours of hands-on gameplay of Switch 2 games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-is-just-the-start-7-hours-of-switch-2-gameplay-is-coming-this-week-in-nintendo-treehouse-streams/). Needless to say, you won't want to miss either of them, as they're sure to give us plenty more insight into the titles populating Nintendo's release calendar this year.
