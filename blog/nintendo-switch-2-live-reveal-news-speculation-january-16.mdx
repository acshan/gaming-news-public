> The Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer showcases new hardware including improved Joy-Cons (with potential mouse functionality), a larger screen, and a new mystery button.  A possible Mario Kart 9 and backwards compatibility are hinted at, with a dedicated Nintendo Direct set for April 2025.

Our very own Dustin Bailey argues that there seems to be [a deep-cut reference to the 1993 puzzle game Yoshi's Cookie](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/the-switch-2-surprise-im-most-excited-about-is-mario-kart-9s-yoshi-shaped-roadside-diner-named-yoshis-which-appears-to-tribute-a-32-year-old-classic-snes-puzzler/) in that Mario Kart 9 footage seen in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer. His case is admittedly tenuous, but also compelling.

"Maybe I'm reaching to think this is an official tribute," writes Bailey, "but at a minimum it looks like Nintendo's bringing Yoshi back to the kitchen after a long, long time away."



While there's no definitive launch date for the Nintendo Switch 2 as of yet, analyst Dr. Serkan Toto, who is CEO of Japan games industry consultancy company Kantan Games, notes that the South Korea hands-on event in Seoul goes through June 1.

"So it very much looks like a spring release is not possible anymore," Toto [tells GamesRadar+](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/june-sounds-a-lot-more-realistic-for-the-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-analyst-says-as-hands-on-event-dates-suggest-the-console-is-skipping-spring/), "and June sounds a lot more realistic."



*If*, and it's a big *if*, the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers really can function like a computer mouse, our own senior writer Austin Wood is very excited.

"[T]he new Joy-Con controllers can seemingly double as gaming mouse-like peripherals thanks to a new sensor and a clip-on attachment with very mouse-like pads on the bottom," [writes Wood](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/after-handheld-pcs-like-the-steam-deck-cribbed-from-nintendo-switch-the-switch-2s-new-joy-cons-could-harness-pc-gamings-most-powerful-weapon-the-mouse/). "The total functionality of what I'm calling Joy-Con slide mode still remains to be seen, but everything shown so far lines up with leaks pointing to a full-on Mouse-Con, and it's got me dreaming of the pinpoint palm precision I enjoy on PC."



In all honesty, we're [left with more questions than answers about the Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/the-switch-2-trailer-really-lingers-on-those-updated-analog-sticks-will-the-stick-drift-curse-finally-end/) after today's reveal. And given that Nintendo has explicitly flagged a Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct for early April, we might all be left collectively waiting until then for much in the way of details.



Speaking of inferences to be made by staring at the reveal trailer, Nintendo sure did spend a significant amount of time [lingering on those shots of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con analog sticks](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/the-switch-2-trailer-really-lingers-on-those-updated-analog-sticks-will-the-stick-drift-curse-finally-end/), huh? It zooms in, we seem them rotate around, and more.

This could purely be an aesthetic choice and lack any further meaning, but given how prominent Joy-Con drift has been as a problem, it could also be something more. Maybe Nintendo's actually upgraded the hardware here to prevent similar issues from cropping up with the new console?



We've touched on the hardware differences between the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 already, but now our very own Dustin Bailey has done some napkin math (with the help of Photoshop) that indicates [the Nintendo Switch 2 screen is roughly around 30% bigger than the original](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-teases-that-the-switch-2-screen-will-be-around-30-percent-bigger-than-the-original-but-i-desperately-hope-they-wont-make-us-wait-for-an-oled-option/). That is, of course, assuming that the various promotional materials released so far as at equal scale.



Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 is officially backwards compatible with Switch games, and it's releasing later this year, now seems like as good a time as any to seriously considering picking up some of [the best Switch exclusives](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-switch-exclusives/). While the fine print on backwards compatibility likely means that the *entire *library isn't making the jump, it seems reasonable to assume the the vast majority will.

Plus, even if you grab a Switch exclusive that doesn't make the jump, you'll still have an awesome game on your hands, right?



According to [a Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/nintendo-to-unveil-next-generation-switch-2-in-april), video game analyst Robin Zhu from the firm Sanford C. Bernstein claims that Nintendo's supply chain network at this point, which has been adjusted, could [accommodate over 20 million Switch 2 console sales in its first year](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-can-handle-20-million-switch-2-sales-in-the-consoles-first-year-analyst-predicts-hopefully-preventing-any-scalper-plagues/). For the sake of comparison, Nintendo sold around 15 million of the original Nintendo Switch in the first year after its release.



Following a bunch of leaks, rumors, and [claims that Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers would in fact updated IR sensors](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/the-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-ir-sensors-explained/), it sure looks like the reveal trailer indicates they do. In fact, there's a whole bit in the trailer where the two Joy-Cons are drifting around upright on their sides in a way that makes both of them seem like a computer mouse of sorts with the ability to track movement.

What kind of games could make use of using two computer mice at once? Who knows! But it's somewhat exciting to daydream about.



In other granular news, the [Nintendo Switch 2 looks to have an additional USB-C port on the top](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-2-has-an-extra-usb-c-port-on-top-and-i-hope-that-means-we-dont-have-to-deal-with-a-fiddly-dock-door-for-controller-chargers-and-ethernet-adapters/) between a headphone jack and what looks to be an exhaust. It seems like this is on top (literally, arguably) of the traditional USB-C port that the previous Switch has on the bottom.

As staff writer Dustin Bailey notes, maybe this means more flexibility on accessories. "It also hopefully means we won't have to deal with a dock door as we did with the previous console," writes Bailey. "I don't know about you, but I hate feeling like I'm about to break that flimsy-feeling dock every time I need to swap some cables around."



We've covered the fact that it sure looks like there's a new Mario Kart coming for the Nintendo Switch 2 based on the reveal trailer, but in more granular news (that only further cements the thought this is a new game) it explicitly [looks like Donkey Kong has a new design](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/switch-2-mario-kart-trailer-reveals-a-whole-new-donkey-kong-seemingly-inspired-by-the-mario-movie-dk-aint-look-right/) in it. It's largely in the background, but folks seem to think it's reminiscent of DK's design in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Whatever the case, it does appear to have been changed.



We know the Nintendo Switch 2 is releasing in 2025, and that a dedicated Nintendo Direct about the latest and greatest console is set for April 2, 2025. What we *don't *know is exactly how much the Nintendo Switch 2 will cost or when, exactly, pre-orders will go live. There's no telling about the former, but we can at least make an educated guess on the latter.

[As our managing editor of hardware Tabitha Baker notes](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders/), pre-orders for the original Nintendo Switch began immediately following the end of its own dedicated Nintendo Direct. If history repeats itself, that would mean Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders would begin on April 2 as well. That's all theoretical at this point, however, and there's still several months to go before any sort of confirmation.



The Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controllers do actually have something that's almost impossible to speculate about: [a mystery button on the right controller under the Home button](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/newly-revealed-nintendo-switch-2-has-a-mysterious-new-button-and-no-one-knows-what-it-does-yet/). Previously leaks and rumors had pointed to a "C" button of some kind, though this doesn't look to be in line with that chatter.

Notably, the form seems pretty similar to the traditional screenshot button found on the left Joy-Con for the original Nintendo Switch. But in the official material for the Nintendo Switch 2, that button appears to still be there. So, what does this one do, then?



Speaking of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, [the Joy-Cons are the most clearly updated bit of gear](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/gaming-controllers/nintendo-switch-2-joy-cons-compared-how-do-the-new-controllers-stack-up-against-the-ones-we-know/) in all the official promotional material. While Nintendo's yet to actually come out and *say *what the differences are and how it all works or functions, it's pretty easy to tell that there's a new mounting system, which leaks has long claimed would be magnetic. The reveal video also indicates there's absolutely some connecting pins in addition, though the exact purpose is unclear.



The full specs on the Nintendo Switch 2 are anticipated to release alongside the Switch 2 Direct in April, but there's plenty that's already obviously different about the new console from the old. Based on the reveal trailer and official images alone, it [looks like the Nintendo Switch 2 has a larger screen with a redesigned stand and significantly updated controllers.](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/nintendo-switch-2-vs-nintendo-switch/) It also looks... thicker, for lack of a better term.



In fact, we are making an *assumption* that the trailer displayed Mario Kart 8 running to highlight the backwards compatibility features. But our News Editor is *convinced* that this may actually be a sneaky first look at a rumored Mario Kart 9 in action... you can [read his reasoning right here](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/im-convinced-that-mario-kart-9-has-been-confirmed-as-the-first-nintendo-switch-2-game/), and to be honest it is a compelling argument.



While we knew that the Nintendo Switch 2 would feature backwards compatibility following comments from the company last year, it's good to see it reaffirmed in the reveal trailer. We've already started looking at [Nintendo Switch 2 backwards compatibility](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-explained/) and where the restrictions may be, as not *everything* will be playable on the new system. 



While I am desperately trying to pull some nice screenshots of the Switch 2 out of that announcement trailer, Nintendo has just release the first official Switch 2 image. Any thoughts on that logo?

There's going to be an opportunity to get your hands on the Nintendo Switch 2 ahead of its release in 2025. Nintendo has just confirmed that an events will take place in Paris, London, Berlin, Milan, Amsterdam, and Madrid to play the new system early. (Although there's no word yet on whether US dates are planned)

[Ticket registration](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Campaigns/Nintendo-Switch-2-Experience-London-2722997.html) begins on January 17th at 14:00 (UK time). Nintendo says that "tickets will be made available through a free-to-enter, randomly selected draw. Enter the draw anytime during the registration period for a chance to attend."



There's going to be a Nintendo Direct coming on April 2, 2025 with more information on the Switch 2. This dedicated showcase is where Nintendo is expected to dive into full details about the new system, including its specs and feature-set.

Here it is!

Tom Warren, senior editor at The Verge (and one of the reporters to corroborate the original story suggesting the reveal would be happening today) has just [taken to Blue Sky](https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3lfubtr2kx225) to say... something. He's posted a gif of Mario dancing. Which could be read one of two ways: either something is happening soon, or we could all just use a break from the tension this speculation is generating. 

I can’t work out what to do for my lunch today. Do I have a sandwich or some soup? Or perhaps I should Switch between the 2[January 16, 2025](https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/1879852277705720047)

Former Gamesindustry.biz head Chris Dring is teasing that an announcement could be imminent. "It's getting pretty close" he teased, although there's still no word on whether he's just joining in on the chaos or reading the tea leaves. 

It's almost 1pm here in the UK, and some parts of America are beginning to wake up – if you're only just joining us for this joyful day of rampant speculation, welcome!



As Nintendo Switch 2 leaks keep coming, accessory maker Genki clarifies "We do not own or possess a black market console."

A strange headline, but apt given what's happened since CES. Genki recently admitted that a cover for the Switch 2 it had on display during event was [based on leaks](https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/company-behind-viral-switch-2-mock-up-backtracks-says-its-cover-accessory-was-based-on-leaks-as-nintendo-wades-in-to-clarify-ces-images-are-not-official/), although that [didn't stop Nintendo's lawyers](https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims) from visiting the company to find out why the internet was learning so much about the Switch 2 design based on its accessories. 



While it's expected that the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal (whether it comes today or not) will be exclusively focused on hardware, that doesn't mean we can't begin to speculate on what the launch lineup might look like. 

Nintendo has few [upcoming Switch games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-nintendo-switch-games/) aligned for 2025, but the two biggest are undoubtedly [Metroid Prime 4: Beyond](https://www.gamesradar.com/metroid-prime-4-guide/) and [Pokemon Legends Z-A](https://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-guide/). Were I a betting man, I'd think that Metroid Prime 4 will be a prime candidate for launch, whereas Pokemon Legends seems earlier in production. 

There's also been a lot of noise this last week about extensive third-party support for the new system. [Rumors have suggested](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/metal-gear-solid-delta-and-assassins-creed-mirage-reportedly-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-as-third-party-support-revs-up/) that Ubisoft is preparing everything from Assassin's Creed Mirage and Rainbow Six Siege for launch, with Xbox even considering introducing Halo: The Master Chief Collection to the Nintendo ecosystem.

If we head into pure speculation territory, I personally wouldn't be surprised if the console launched alongside Mario Kart 9, an enhanced version of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and perhaps a new version of Ring Fit to help attract more of a mainstream market in the launch window. As for a new 3D Mario game? It's been almost eight years since Super Mario Odyssey landed, but I'd be surprised to see a new 3D Mario go from announcement to release in just a few short months...



"We would hear 30-minute lectures [on] the value of surprise"

You know what, I've worked as a member of the video game media for well over a decade at this point and I honestly can't recall an occasion where Nintendo has been hit with so many leaks. The company is historically tight-lipped, operating on its own time and under its own rules. 

So I can't say that I was all that surprised to learn that former PR managers for the publisher are suggesting that Nintendo is "really mad" to "the most severe level" about the Switch 2 leaks. "We would hear 30-minute lectures [on] the value of surprise," [says Kit Ellis](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/nintendo-is-really-mad-to-the-most-severe-level-about-the-switch-2-leaks-say-former-pr-managers-they-are-very-very-very-upset/). 

Well, you know what, I would probably be "very, very, very upset" too if I worked at Nintendo. Thankfully, I don't – so have been instead watching with mild curiosity as everything from potential specs to the console's refreshed design have leaked onto the internet over the last six months. Hopefully an official reveal will finally put an end to the chaos.



Nintendo unveiled the original Nintendo Switch on October 20, 2016. The company signalled that an announcement was incoming the night before – teasing the news at 5:30pm PST before going live with a reveal trailer at 7am PST. 

The first look provided precious little information, instead opting to focus on the hybrid-console's versatility and its ability to bring people together no matter where they wanted to play. Interestingly, Nintendo pulled that original trailer off of its YouTube channels last year – believed to be because of music licensing issues – although you can still find an [archive of it over at the official NoA Twitter](https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/789103913328709632?lang=en-GB) if you want to take a walk down memory lane. 

Now it is worth noting that Nintendo is yet to signal whether any announcements are coming today for the Switch 2, although that doesn't necessarily mean that one isn't. The truth is, the internet has changed a *lot* in the last eight years, and the Nintendo Switch has proven to be so popular that the company could quite easily get away with shadow dropping a reveal and still pulling the attention of all mainstream media outlets onto its reveal. 



Why is everybody expecting the Switch 2 reveal today? It all started back on January 13, when [multiple outlets corroborated reports](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-reportedly-coming-this-week-ahead-of-june-launch/) from industry commentator Nate the Hate that Nintendo was preparing to release a Switch 2 trailer on January 16, 2024.

"I can share with you that Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week… I have been told Switch 2 will be revealed on Thursday, January 16,” [said Nate the Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4). "I've heard that the reveal itself is going to focus almost exclusively on the console itself. There is not going to be any presence of games. There could be a game shown running on the screen, depending on how the trailer is put together, but software is not going to be a focus."

Well, today is the day and we're still yet to get any indication from Nintendo that anything is happening today. That doesn't mean that Nintendo isn't going to surprise drop a trailer at some point today, however. Last night, [Nate the Hate was sticking by their reporting](https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1879699723415855109), when asked whether Ninty was preparing a shadow drop.

Which is all to say that there's still a lot of noise. Naturally, the second we hear anything firm we will let you know!

Is today really the big day? Let's find out together.
