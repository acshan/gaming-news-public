Despite [<u>Nintendo's lawsuit</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/palworlds-best-defense-against-part-of-nintendos-lawsuit-could-be-an-8-year-old-gta-5-mod-according-to-one-patent-expert/), it's no secret that [<u>Palworld</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/palworld/) has seen a height of success that few creature collectors aside from [<u>Pokemon</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/pokemon/) do - but global community manager John "Bucky" Buckley doesn't think that means Pocketpair had a deserved nomination stolen from its game or that it was "snubbed" at this year's Game Awards.

Speaking in a recent [thread](https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1858578343941337286), Buck addresses the rumors from players alleging that Palworld should've been nominated. "No, I donâ€™t think Palworld was snubbed," he writes. "Twitter has become such a banterless place. Stop being so overdramatic gamers. Not everything is a conspiracy." He then jokes that while Palworld may not have been "snubbed," that doesn't mean other games weren't - like Satisfactory, for instance.

No, I donâ€™t think Palworld was snubbed. Twitter has become such a banterless place. Stop being so over dramatic gamers. Not everything is a conspiracy. That being saidâ€¦Satisfactory was 1000% snubbed and Iâ€™ll be voicing that opinion ad nauseam at The Game Awards in personðŸ˜¡[November 18, 2024](https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1858578343941337286)

"That being saidâ€¦Satisfactory was 1000% snubbed," jests the community lead, "and Iâ€™ll be voicing that opinion ad nauseam at The Game Awards in person." Amusingly, Satisfactory's own community manager and programmer Snutt Treptow has left a comment under Bucky's post since, writing that "the award was all the friends we made along the way!" In response, Bucky leaves an emoji depicting eyes and says "So trueâ€¦but alsoâ€¦"

Other replies are just as humorous, offering a breath of fresh air amid the conspiracies that Bucky was originally addressing himself. "I talked to every judge and said 'Don't nominate Palworld or else' and then I pounded my fist into my palm to show them what 'or else' meant," reads one from Kinda Funny's Greg Miller. Overall, it's a wholesome thread in my opinion - stemming from a level-headed approach to quite a heavy topic, too.
