Shoreline Games outlined its 2025 agenda at the Golden Joystick Awards, revealing three new trailers for some of its upcoming slate of games. 

Nova Hearts led the charge, the latest from Othercide developer Lightbulb Crew. This strategic turn-based combat game has you battling with enemies from another dimension, using your own supercharged set of powers to help turn the tide against an array of powerful supervillains. And when the dust has settled on all of that battling, you can pick up your in-game phone and start some unlikely romances – texting, talking, and dating with friends, enemies, and those who occupy the regular world around you. Who knows, if a relationship goes well you may just unlock some new powers to draw into combat. [<u>Head to the Nova Hearts Steam page</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506290/Nova_Hearts/) to Wishlist the game and try a free demo. 

Next up was Sanatorium, a card-based workplace adventure from developer Zeitglas,  which is designed to let you explore the hardships and difficult decisions of working in a hospital circa-1923. With a strong focus on narrative, and over 100 cards to uncover and experiment with, there's never been a better time to [<u>head to the Sanatorium Steam page</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059090/Sanatorium__A_Mental_Asylum_Simulator/) and try out the demo for yourself ahead of its release in Q2 2025.

And closing out the Golden Joystick Awards appearance was a new look at Onirism, which is set to move out of early access in Q3 2025. The adventure game made its debut back in 2019, and developer Crimson Tales has been hard at work on making the world of Crearia a true delight. The game looks delightful, and has had a great reception through Early Access, so you'll want to [<u>head over to Steam and wishlist the game</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1057640/Onirism/) to get updates on its progress through the new year.
