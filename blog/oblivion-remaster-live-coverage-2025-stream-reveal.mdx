For anyone that's been concerned about what Oblivion Remastered might mean for the Skyblivion mod, there's good news: not only does it seem like [Bethesda isn't going to put a stop to the project](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/thanks-todd-bethesda-gave-the-whole-skyblivion-mod-team-keys-to-oblivion-remastered-and-made-it-clear-that-they-have-no-intention-of-shutting-down-our-project/), but it even game the mod team copies of Oblivion Remastered.

Thanks, Todd.

You know what? Say what you will, but Bethesda knows how to put together a trailer. The new official trailer for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is no different. Even if it is technically an older game, the trailer feels right at home in 2025.

But you don't have to just take my word for it; you can see for yourself:

While the release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered might be considered overall good news, there is a bit of bad news in the mix.

Despite the franchise's history of supporting mods, [Oblivion Remastered... doesn't](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/bethesda-says-mods-are-not-supported-for-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-despite-its-pro-mod-history/). Sorry.

If you're looking to download The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered for yourself in order to see what's new or even check it out for the first time, be aware that it's something of a chunky boy.

How chunky? At 125GB, [it can fit roughly 27 of 2009's Oblivion GOTY edition inside of it.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/slaps-roof-of-rpg-at-125gb-on-pc-oblivion-remastered-can-fit-27-of-2009s-oblivion-goty-edition/)

If you happened to be one of those left wondering whether folks still cared about Oblivion, it's maybe worth noting that the remaster is [already the global top-selling game on Steam](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/pc-gamers-seem-happy-to-pay-usd50-for-oblivion-remastered-its-already-the-global-top-selling-game-on-steam-and-it-came-out-literally-40-minutes-ago/). That... was fast.

We're now getting a deep dive gameplay stream, in which the wonderful Wes Johnson - that's the voice of Sheogorath to name just one of his Bethesda characters - is seeing the remaster for the first time. Lovely stuff.



SURPRISE! The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is out now, and it's on Xbox Series, Game Pass, Steam, and PS5. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some file space to clear...

We'll be able to sprint in the remaster, which is a lovely addition. From first glance, it feels like there are smart additions, and we've got devs from both Bethesda and Virtuos talking about the careful approach they took to the remaster.

All of Oblivion's "quirkier" dialogue remains - thank The Nine - but new lines have been recorded as well, which will go a long way toward keeping some of the original game's oddness. Greetings!

Now there's confirmation that gameplay has been tweaked, from UI to audio. Levelling is now "the best of both worlds," leaning more into Skyrim, while combat has more animations and a weightier feel. Third person has also been "modernized" to have all the same features you get from first-person.



For those who don't have the stream on, this is how Oblivion looks in Unreal Engine 5.

An important bit of confirmation, here - Oblivion's remaster will indeed be launching with all add-ons and expansions. Trip to the Shivering Isles, anyone?

We're now seeing original 2006 footage stacked up against the remaster, really hammering home just how phenomenal this looks. In truth, the screenshots we've seen didn't do the real thing justice - it looks even better in motion!

The remaster aims to make Oblivion "more friendly" to modern hardware, which will be a relief to anyone who's sick of the original game crashing every time you tab in and out.

We're getting a lot of talking heads from Bethesda here, with devs speaking from the heart about what Oblivion means to them. Lovely look at the game's legacy from the inside, here!

Todd Howard confirms Bethesda is working on "the sixth chapter" - yes, [The Elder Scrolls 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-location-news-races/) - but for now, it's all Oblivion. "We want people to feel the way they did then," says Howard of the remaster.

There we have it! That's The Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion Remastered officially, *officially*, announced. Let's see when it's coming out, shall we?

Here we go! The stream's now live, and it's kicking right off into a trailer. Confirmation it's from Virtuous there, too.

The stream's just finished playing Auriel's Ascension, one of many gems to come from Oblivion's soundtrack. There's also been some ominous thundering, but we'll move past that. Grab your snacks, get a drink sorted, and get settled - 10 minutes to go!

We're now just 20 minutes out from the stream! As a reminder - don't worry if you can't watch it, as I'll be sharing live highlights right here.

I'm nosing through our [Oblivion main quest walkthrough](https://www.gamesradar.com/oblivion-main-quest-walkthrough/) and desperately trying to remember the last time I actually finished it, instead of getting side-tracked by the Dark Brotherhood. It's, er, been a while. Anyway - how are you?

In just under an hour, we'll have the answer to our biggest question: will Oblivion's remaster be shadow-dropped - that is, launching immediately - or releasing further down the line? Rumors that have taken us this far suggest the former, but you never know until it's *official*.

I can't talk about Oblivion without sharing clips of it being Very Silly, and this one's an all-timer. I do hope the original game's inherent silliness survives its glossy makeover. Farewell... unless?

We're still an hour and 20 minutes away from Bethesda's stream, so join me in re-reading our original [Oblivion review](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-review/) from 2006. I suppose a "bar-raising masterpiece" would explain why we're still hanging off its every move after 19 years?



For anyone joining us fresh, some context: while rumors of an Oblivion remaster have been swirling for years, [its existence was seemingly confirmed when screenshots of the project appeared to leak](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-looks-more-real-than-ever-as-screenshots-from-virtuos-leak-and-reports-point-to-a-shadow-drop-next-week/) last week. The remaster is said to be in the hands of developer Virtuos, and given the images were sourced through Virtuos' own website, that's looking to be the case. Exciting!

By Azura, by Azura, by Azura! Today's the day that a lot of people have been waiting for, with Bethesda's mysterious livestream set to kick off in just two hours. We've not got a lot to work on from the stream itself, which is currently listed on YouTube as "All will be revealed...."
