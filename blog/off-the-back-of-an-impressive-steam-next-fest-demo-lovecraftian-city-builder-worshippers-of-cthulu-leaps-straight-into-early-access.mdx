Fresh off a successful Steam Next Fest demo, and already turning heads after its early access launch, Lovecraftian city-builder Worshippers of Cthulu is now available, bringing a touch of eldritch madness to the colony sim world.

[Worshippers of Cthulu](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807150/Worshippers_of_Cthulhu/) places you as the leader of a cult dedicated to the eponymous Old God, leaving you in charge of shaping the destiny of each one of your followers. Some will toil to build your monument to Cthulu, others will defend its borders - and others still will devote their lives to the dark rituals that will bring about Cthulu's return.

Only the strongest cults will be able to bring that to bear, however, so you'll have to expand your cities across multiple islands, overseeing everything from the day-to-day management of your cultists to the production chains that will turn your city from a burgeoning city into a world-conquering civilization, summoning powerful monsters to convert the non-believers - or destroy them.

During the recent Steam Next Fest, Worshippers of Cthulu's expansive demo was one of the biggest city-builders available. But not content to rest on its laurels, developer Crazy Goat Games isn't done with a simple demo - Worshippers of Cthulu is live now in early access, and is already garnering some impressive reviews from early players. And if that's not enough of a reason to check it out for yourself, perhaps the introductory discount (available until November 4), will be.

A darker type of city-builder that offers incredible control of not only the worshippers that make up your settlement, but also the monsters that have made Lovecraft's name synonymous with eldritch horror across the world, Worshippers of Cthulu is available now on Steam. You can find out more about the game via its official [Twitter](https://x.com/woc_cthulhu) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@crazygoatgames_studio) accounts.
