JRPG love letter Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is coming in hot next year with a full release that looks on par with plenty of other AAA games, though its origins are far more indie.

Speaking to [Edge in issue 404](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2961&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-1357461445583238680&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Faz-magazines%2F6936949%2Fedge-magazine-single-issue.thtml) (on sale now), creative director Guillaume Broche recalls writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen joining very early on as a voice actress before quickly becoming a co-writer and lead writer. "Then it built very organically - just for fun in the beginning. Everybody was working for free," he says.

It wouldn't be until later that the scope grew to a commercial release, with Broche taking the leap to leave [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) and spin up Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 studio Sandfall Interactive. Even then, though, development remained scrappy for a while.

"I started off in Belgium during the pandemic and then moved to Montpelier, where I went with Guillaume and Francois [Meurisse, COO and producer] to an Airbnb for about a month," artist Nicholas Maxis-Francombe says. "About a week before we had to leave, we were like, 'Oh, we have to find apartments.'"

Thankfully, once the team settled, they raised the funds to create a vertical slice that secured them a publisher in Kepler Interactive, "who generously gave us enough money to finish the game."

Since its reveal, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has continued to grab eyes – mine especially – for a few reasons. At first, it was the [impressive level of graphics slapped atop a turn-based RPG](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/dev-of-french-jrpg-that-stunned-at-the-xbox-showcase-not-hiding-influence-of-persona-and-final-fantasy-8-9-and-10-but-wants-to-find-our-own-direction/) because, hey, as Persona frequently shows, being modern doesn't have to mean leaving that combat style behind. It also has [oodles of vocal talent](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/promising-turn-based-rpg-clair-obscur-confirms-spring-launch-but-more-importantly-mocap-legend-andy-serkis-plus-final-fantasy-and-baldurs-gate-3-actors/), from Daredevil himself, Charlie Cox, to mocap magician Andy Serkis.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is due to release next spring.
