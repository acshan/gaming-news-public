Spooky season may be over, but if you're still looking for a touch of terror, this horror board game hasn't been cheaper in a long time.

Mansions of Madness has had a chunky 36% saving as part of this year's Black Friday sale, and it's currently [$70.49 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMansions-Madness-Board-Game-2nd%2Fdp%2FB01J4NB6CO%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-1516026444380369112-20) rather than the full $109.99. I've not seen it cheaper in roughly a year - the last time it hit that kind of low was last November, and it's rarely came within even $10 of this price in all that time. So, if you've had the horror board game in your sights, now's your time to strike.

This is just one of the [Black Friday board game deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/black-friday-board-game-deals/) floating around at the moment, of course, but it's amongst the best considering how rarely Mansions of Madness gets a discount. I've watched this like a hawk myself for quite a while, and it stubbornly hovers at the $80 - $90 range most of the time.

If you're a fan of horror board games, you're gonna enjoy Mansions of Madness. Set in the Lovecraftian Arkham Horror universe (which you may have seen across other games, including the fantastic [Unfathomable](https://www.gamesradar.com/unfathomable-review/) - one of the [best board games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-board-games/) for co-op, in my opinion), it sees you exploring a house where nothing bad has ever happened. Nope. No, sir. That's some prime real estate and *not *a hotbed of demonic terror.



In other words, it's a step up from [Betrayal at House on the Hill](https://www.gamesradar.com/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-3rd-edition-review/). Seeing as the latter is one of my all-time favorites, that's more than enough to pique my interest. However, it's a lot deeper. Although it shares similar gameplay, this is more like a dungeon-crawling RPG with its own companion app.

Still, I appreciate that the price may still keep this out of reach for some. With that in mind, I'd highly recommend trying the aforementioned Betrayal - it's currently [$29.99 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FHasbro-Gaming-Betrayal-Cooperative-Scenarios%2Fdp%2FB09H23M384%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-3088918895087471887-20) instead of $55.99.
