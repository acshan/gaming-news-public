Wonder Woman and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor developer Monolith Productions, MultiVersus developer Player First Games, and mobile-focused studio WB San Diego have all been shut down. The [Wonder Woman game](https://www.gamesradar.com/wonder-woman-game-guide/) has been canceled altogether.

The news first broke via Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d). A more formal report from the outlet is forthcoming. Reached for comment by GamesRadar+, Warner Bros. confirmed the news in a statement which was also shared with other [journalists](https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lizl4fakrs24).

"We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises - Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones," WB says in its statement. "After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios - Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them. The development of Monolith's Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward."

Warner Bros. previously noted its [intentions to focus on Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/warner-bros-knows-its-batman-games-are-popular-and-plans-to-focus-its-development-efforts-on-core-franchises-like-dc-mortal-kombat-hogwarts-legacy-and-game-of-thrones/) in a financial report last year. Today's statement doesn't acknowledge the irony of doubling down on DC games while canceling a Wonder Woman title.

The end of Player First Games is perhaps sadly unsurprising, as its big project [MultiVersus is officially shutting down later this year](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fighting/wb-games-smash-bros-like-multiversus-is-going-offline-for-good-a-full-year-after-it-came-back-from-the-dead/) after a big relaunch that failed to get much traction outside of the game's dedicated playerbase. MultiVersus originally launched in July 2022 as a Super Smash Bros.-style platform fighting game featuring characters from a wide array of Warner Bros. properties.

The end of Monolith Productions comes three years after the reveal of its big open-world Wonder Woman game, which we've seen very little of since its announcement. Another [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues) earlier this month suggested that the game was [$100 million in the hole and struggling with tech and leadership](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/3-years-since-reveal-open-world-wonder-woman-game-from-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-devs-reportedly-usd100-million-in-the-hole-and-struggling-with-tech-and-leadership/).

Monolith was founded in 1994, and produced numerous cult classics like Blood, No One Lives Forever, FEAR, and Condemned: Criminal Origins over the years. The company was acquired by WB in 2004, and prior to the Wonder Woman game, had met with critical and commercial success with Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.
