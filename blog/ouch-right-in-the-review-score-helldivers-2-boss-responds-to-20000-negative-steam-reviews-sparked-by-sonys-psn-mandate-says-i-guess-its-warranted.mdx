[Helldivers 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/helldivers-2-guide/) is about to actually start enforcing its previously stated requirement for players on Steam to sign in with a PlayStation account, and to put it mildly, the [community isn't taking it well](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-hit-helldivers-2-after-players-learn-they-need-a-psn-account-to-continue-playing/). After 20,000 negative reviews in less than 24 hours, the game's developers say they get why players are upset.

"Ouch, right in the review score," CEO and creative director Johan Pilestedt says on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1786454659256758447), sharing an image of the game's recent Steam review average, which has dropped precipitously over the past day. "Well, I guess it's warranted. Sorry everyone for how this all transpired. I hope we will make it up and regain the trust by providing a continued great game experience. I just want to make great games!"

The devs have [reminded players that "it's Sony's decision, not ours" amid the PSN backlash](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-devs-remind-players-its-sonys-decision-not-ours-amid-psn-backlash-we-always-knew-this-day-would-get-here-and-its-going-about-how-i-expected/), but that hasn't done much to settle the community down. [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/) is, of course, the publisher of Helldivers 2, even on PC, and has a vested interest in getting as many players into its account ecosystem as possible. That's doubly true with [PC ports of games like Ghost of Tsushima](https://www.gamesradar.com/after-9-years-ghost-of-tsushima-is-the-first-playstation-game-on-pc-with-trophies/) on the horizon, which will be the first Sony-published PC game to offer PSN features like trophies and friends lists.

"It's sad of course, and not representative of what people truly think about the game," community manager Twinbeard says on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/helldivers) in response to the negative reviews, "but that's sth [sic] that can happen when people are frustrated with something. I hope the tide will turn back as things get ironed out and we hopefully will get more info."
