Ninja Gaiden 4 will end the action-platform series' decade-long dry spell when it releases this fall, Team Ninja announced at the [<u>Xbox Developer Direct</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/xbox-developer-direct-2025-live-all-of-the-latest-xbox-news-from-the-big-showcase/), and the developer has also prepared and just shadow-dropped a remaster of 2008's Ninja Gaiden 2, dubbed Ninja Gaiden 2 Black

"The wait is finally over," Team Ninja director Fumihiko Yasuda says. "We are excited to announce Ninja Gaiden 4, a new mainline entry in this high-speed action series, where you become the ultimate ninja and take on relentless enemies in fierce combat."

The accompanying gameplay, showing off combat made in collaboration with Nier: Automata and Bayonetta developer Platinum Games, certainly seems to prove it. The game's inky new protagonist, Yakumo, slinks all over a cursed Tokyo, delivering nasty gut stabs and bloody finishers to every enemy he encounters. Series star Ryu Hayabusa will also play a "pivotal role in the story," Yasuda says, but as Yakuma's adversary.

Overall, Ninja Gaiden 4 looks like a dynamic return to form for Team Ninja, whose 2014 game, Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, was, [<u>as we said at the time</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/yaiba-ninja-gaiden-z-review/), an "unentertaining, cringeworthy affair."

A disappointment like that is sure to send any ninja into hiding, but enough time has passed for the Gaiden geyser to start gushing again. Team Ninja will release Ninja Gaiden 4 on Game Pass, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PS5 this fall. Platinum-side director Yuji Nakao said the game is currently "about 70 - 80% complete, and we've entered the polishing phase" after years in development.

Again, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is out today on Xbox and in Game Pass. "We chose NINJA GAIDEN 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series," Yasuda said on [the Xbox blog](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/). "We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like NINJA GAIDEN Black was for the first game.”
