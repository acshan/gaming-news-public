The [<u>Palworld</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/palworld-guide/) developers have shared their plans for future improvements to the game, and players are also adding their own suggestions.

Over on Twitter (via [<u>Automaton</u>](https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-roadmap-reveals-plans-to-add-crossplay-and-final-boss/)), the Palworld devs tell us what features they're working on ahead of the game's official release. It can be easy to forget it's still in early access since it's been out since early last year.

Co-op crossplay, a final boss and an ending scenario, and more ways to make Pals stronger are just a few of the many features being worked on. Minecraft was out for ages before it got the Ender Dragon, so I wonder what a final boss Pal would look like.

The devs are also working on world transfers for Pals, which I think means trading a powerful Pal from one world to another, as well as improvements to object placement on the map, base Pals, optimization, and UX.Â 

There are also new technologies and Pals on the way, as well as more game collaborations as well as [<u>the Terraria collab</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/palworld-and-terraria-have-a-crossover-coming-in-2025-but-the-community-manager-is-upset-the-ai-accusations-will-stick-with-us-for-years/) that's already been teased. While these are all welcome plans, fans of the game have added their own suggestions in replies to the tweet.

[<u>HoshikoRito</u>](https://x.com/HoshikoRito/status/1881053365939093627) wants the devs to "look into increasing base size, with the amount of pals and facilities increasing the spaces are getting real cramped unless you build vertically then itâ€™s just a pathing challenge."

ðŸ“…Future RoadmapðŸ“…We've been updating the game since the start of Early Access, and we'll continue to update Palworld as we prepare for the official release!The future roadmap includes the following:-CO-OP Crossplay-World Transfers for Pals-Final Boss / Ending Scenarioâ€¦ pic.twitter.com/k8UuMhg5r1[January 19, 2025](https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1880970972422951384)

I played the game religiously at launch, and I also found it tough to optimize my bases. You can have a few, which is great, as you certainly need some mining outposts and manufacturing centers, but it's annoying having to travel between bases all the time. Having bigger bases would help by allowing us to merge the functionality of some.

I agree with that, too. Currently, the villages don't feel like they do much other than provide a shop. I'd like to know how people in the land of Pals feel about their environment. Are they happy with their Pals, or terrified by the weird players running around gathering up armies of powerful creatures?
