[Path of Exile 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/path-of-exile-2/) has a feature that can automatically party you up with random players. Oh wait, that's a bug, but developer Grinding Gear Games says you can go ahead and "consider it a feature" until it's fixed.

Grinding Gear's long-awaited action-RPG sequel finally launched into Early Access today, and just as [the studio projected in advance](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/as-over-a-million-fans-turn-up-for-path-of-exile-2s-early-access-devs-warn-of-queues-because-thats-more-than-anything-they-could-have-ever-predicted/), [it's facing some pretty serious server issues](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/path-of-exile-2-dev-says-launch-is-relatively-imminent-after-fixing-a-last-minute-crash-leaves-early-access-buyers-waiting-at-the-login-gates/) preventing many players from even being able to log in.

Much less serious is a bug that apparently parties up people who are already in parties with "random players." Frankly, I'm not sure this relatively insignificant bug would even warrant a full news story if it weren't for Grinding Gear's suggestion that maybe it's not so bad a thing to make some new friends, ya loners.

"We're aware of an issue with players in parties sometimes being placed into parties with other random players," reads a tweet from the official Path of Exile Twitter account. "Until we fix this, consider it a feature to enhance your social experience!"

Now, Grinding Gear is obviously joshin' us here. It's just acknowledging the bug and promising a fix in an amusing way, which is somewhat commendable given the amount of much more serious issues it has on its plate.

[The most recent update](https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865178738151034957) from Grinding Gear is that the login issue should be resolved now for Steam users specifically. There's still no word on a timeline for resolution on other platforms, but I've reached out to the studio for clarification and will update this article if I hear back.
