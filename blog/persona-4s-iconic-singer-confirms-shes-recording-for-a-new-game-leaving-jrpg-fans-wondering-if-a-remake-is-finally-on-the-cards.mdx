Could a Persona 4 remake *finally *be on the cards? If you'll excuse my pun, it certainly looks like there's a chance, because singer Shihoko Hirata – best known for her work on the P4 games – has confirmed she's "recording for a new game," promptly sending JRPG fans into a frenzy.

In a [<u>post on Instagram</u>](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGVB6EqJkDs/), the singer notes that "the piece is pretty tough, so I'm a bit nervous about getting it right. But I'll do my best!" As has been pointed out by Twitter account @rudiger__tw, the picture she's attached to her post appears to show MIT Studio, which according to [<u>music database Discogs</u>](https://www.discogs.com/label/302118-Mit-Studio?genre=Stage+%26+Screen&page=1&searchParam=persona), is where recordings for multiple other Persona soundtracks (including Persona 5, Persona 3 Reload, and Persona 4 Dancing All Night) have taken place.

Obviously, the studio isn't *exclusively *used to record music for Persona games, so this in itself isn't a confirmation of anything. However, in the replies to her post, Hirata has liked a number of comments featuring Persona 4 GIFs – could that be another hint? These aren't the only comments she's liked, however, and scrolling back through her older posts, she's liked plenty of Persona-related replies in the past – even one from last May declaring "Persona 4 reload needed," so take that as you will.

Atlus hasn't confirmed if it's working on a shiny new version of Persona 4, but with Persona 3 now freshly remade, a lot of fans have been left wondering when the coming-of-age slash murder-mystery story might get a new lick of paint. Compared to the most recent Persona games, its visuals have become rather dated, even if its gameplay – for the most part – holds up well. Its cheery slice-of-life vibes and delightful cast are still perfectly intact, of course, even if the character models have seen better days.

If the JRPG *was *to get a remake, the question remains whether it'd be for the original version or its re-release. Persona 3 Reload made the surprising decision to leave out the extra story content from Persona 3 FES (which was later added as the Episode Aigis DLC), [<u>as well as P3 Portable's female protagonist</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/persona/persona-3-reload-producer-apologizes-for-the-third-time-for-excluding-portables-female-protagonist-reiterates-its-likely-never-happening-for-the-jrpg-remake/), which felt like quite a missed opportunity. Persona 4 Golden features extra story content, new Social Links, and areas to explore on a scooter – all stuff that'd be a huge shame to miss out on a remake. If it really is happening, here's hoping we get that extended, souped-up version.

*Persona 4 Golden ranks highly on our list of the *[<u><em>best Persona games</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-persona-games/)* for a reason – it's still one of the *[<u><em>best JRPGs</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-jrpgs/)* out there.*
