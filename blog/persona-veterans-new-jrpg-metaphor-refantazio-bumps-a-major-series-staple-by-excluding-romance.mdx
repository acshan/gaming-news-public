Metaphor: ReFantazio won't have any romance options whatsoever, in a stark contrast to past Persona games.

Yesterday, Atlus revealed [Metaphor: ReFantazio would launch later this year on October 11](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/persona-veterans-new-jrpg-metaphor-refantazio-attempts-to-bridge-real-time-and-turn-based-combat-in-a-move-final-fantasy-has-tried-to-make-work-for-years-and-its-out-in-october/), complete with a deep dive into the game's combat and world with director Katsura Hashino. Now, in a new Japanese Q&A segment, it's been revealed that the bonds the player can establish with certain characters won't lead to any romance scenes.

The news was revealed in the Q&A livestream just below, where host Mafia Kajita addressed the topic of romance around the one hour and 36-minute mark. The host revealed that Metaphor: ReFantazio doesn't feature any romance options with bond characters because the new RPG employs a very different bond level system compared to past Atlus games.

This might be a surprise, given that Persona games from Atlus have always allowed the player to romance certain companions. It's worth pointing out, however, that Metaphor: ReFantazio isn't being developed by Persona developer P-Studio at Atlus, but rather Studio Zero, who previously worked on Catherine: Full Body under Atlus. It's easy to understand the confusion since Hashino has headed up the Persona series for well over a decade now.

Although it's not romance, you will be able to unlock new Archetypes by increasing your bond level with characters. Yesterday's Metaphor: ReFantazio presentation from Hashino revealed the Archetype system is what grants new combat classes to characters, and the player can equip a different Archetype class onto any active party member in battle.
