Threads of Time has been an [absolute stunner every time we've seen it](https://www.gamesradar.com/this-stunning-indie-jrpg-is-a-love-letter-to-chrono-trigger-and-final-fantasy/), and just when I thought it couldn't look any better the devs have gone and added a sky pirate to the cast of the JRPG love letter.

Developer Riyo Games has been very forthcoming about Threads of Time's inspirations, as this is a time-traveling JRPG in the SNES style that owes no shortage of debt to Chrono Trigger. You'll fight dinosaurs in a prehistoric age, journey to a futuristic city, and fight impossible monsters at the edge of apocalypse. Even the combat takes a familiar form: turn-based battles built around using team combos within your party.

The "new" Threads of Time trailer that [appeared during today's Humble Games Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Zskx6ypqQ) might look pretty familiar if you've been following the game's development – it's mostly identical to the [Tokyo Game Show trailer that debuted last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/we-finally-got-a-proper-trailer-for-this-beautiful-chrono-trigger-and-final-fantasy-inspired-jrpg-and-its-already-one-of-the-prettiest-2d-games-ive-ever-seen/) – but holy heck does it still look good. Fantastic character designs, impeccable pixel art, and a blend of dynamic camera angles and modern lighting giving it a look to rival [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/)'s HD-2D stunners, and this is still one of the prettiest games I've ever seen.

The *actually *new part of this teaser is the animated scene at the end, where we're introduced to a new, rodent-like sky pirate character named Barza who's downright adorable. JRPGs and sky pirates go together like peanut butter and jelly, and it's tough to imagine a more perfect addition to the cast.

*There's a reason Chrono Trigger still tops our list of the *[<em>best JRPGs</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-jrpgs/)*.*
