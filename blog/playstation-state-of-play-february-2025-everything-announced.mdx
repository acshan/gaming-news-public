And here... we... go...

And just under 10 minutes to go, the actual State of Play countdown placeholder is live! I'm honestly going into this bad boy with zero expectations, but you know what'd go down real nice right now? A new Killzone. Just sayin'.

Sound the alarm: less than 15 minutes to go! Got your snack? Are you hydrated? Might also be good to use the bathroom one final time, just in case.

Just over 30 minutes to go, and now I'm *really *hoping this one's going to knock our collective socks off after GamesRadar+ EIC Josh West told me that Mission: Impossible 2 is – and this is a direct quote – "the only good one." I can't have this energy permeate the night, I just can't.

Just one hour to go! Any last-minute predictions? Personally, I'm hoping for something that's just absolutely wild and unexpected. Show me a new Valkyria Chronicles, Sony. I dare you.

In other news, it sure does look like [the official Lies of P website is currently password protected](https://www.liesofp.com/en-us/) for whatever reason. Now, this could mean nothing at all, or it could mean everything.

If you're not already aware, it's known that [there's Lies of P DLC on the way](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-dlc-for-my-favorite-soulslike-inches-closer-as-lies-of-p-shares-new-teasers-we-aim-to-do-better-on-what-we-did-well-and-improve-in-areas-we-have-room-to-grow/), though we've not really seen or heard much about it. "For the DLC of Lies of P and the sequel, we aim to do better on what we did well and improve in areas we have room to grow," said director Jiwon Choi back in September 2024. "It might sound simple, but I find that sticking to the basics is anything but easy."

Look, maybe it's just my own echo chamber given what I do for a living, but the Bloodborne hopium is *extremely *strong this time around, it feels like. The [recent DMCA business](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/let-me-cope-bloodborne-60fps-mod-creator-hopes-the-remake-is-real-this-time-as-sony-seemingly-sends-a-dmca-after-yet-another-fan-project/) with fan projects is just the latest in a long line of people convincing themselves that some kind of Bloodborne remake or remaster is on the way.

I've no skin in this potential personally as I've never met a FromSoftware game that doesn't feel like it's kicking my shins for funsies, as much as I'd love to love Armored Core, but I'll side with the angels today. Let the record show: I'm with you folks; bring on Bloodborne.

And now that evening has come for my UK brethren, it is once again time for me – US Managing Editor Rollin Bishop – to take the reins and guide all of you through to the end of today's State of Play.

So sit back, relax, and maybe ponder with me the possibility of a new Digimon game called "Digimon Story Time Stranger" being revealed at some point. That is, if [the GameStop placeholder page](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/digimon-story-time-stranger---playstation-5/422053.html) folks are [chattering about online](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1inw9k4/digimon_story_time_ranger_available_for_preorder/) is actually accurate.

We put it to you, dear reader - what Xbox game would you like to see on the PS5? I imagine a certain space-faring Bethesda RPG might be up there.

Elsewhere, [a few whispers ](https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1889342523807527095)are [doing the rounds](https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1889370979702301029) that Hellblade 2 is the next Xbox game to cross the console divide to PlayStation and that it may happen sooner rather than later.

The reports track. Just recently, [Xbox boss Phil Spencer said he isn't ruling out exclusives making the jump](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/phil-spencer-isnt-ruling-out-xbox-exclusives-like-starfield-making-the-jump-to-other-platforms-there-is-no-reason-for-me-to-put-a-ring-fence-around-any-game/) to other platforms, as blocking them "doesn't work for us." Over the past year, we've seen titles like Hi-Fi Rush and Grounded ported to other consoles, with the likes of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle set to join them soon.

Could Hellblade 2 be next?

Interestingly, we learned last year that [a new studio was formed under the Sony umbrella](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/destiny-2-and-marathon-plans-got-overly-ambitious-so-bungie-is-firing-220-people-and-spinning-out-a-sci-fi-action-game-to-form-a-new-studio-within-playstation/) to continue the development of one of Bungie's incubation projects. The news came as Bungie admitted that Destiny 2 and Marathon plans got "overly ambitious," resulting in some developers being laid off or moved elsewhere within Sony.

That's far from confirmation that project 'Gummy Bears' exists, though we do know that *something *is knockin' about.

Back to the good ol' showcase, there's a rumor doing the rounds that we'll see a project from Halo and Destiny veteran Bungie that's currently codenamed 'Gummy Bears.' Outlet [Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/noticia/1350777986/sony-presentara-en-el-state-of-play-un-nuevo-y-curioso-multijugador-nacido-en-bungie-segun-nuestras-fuentes/) reports that the game is coming to PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch, though we'll need to wait and see if anything comes of it.

Speaking of the Lands Between, [we played Elden Ring Nightreign for over 3 hours](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-feels-like-a-mod-in-the-best-way-and-after-playing-it-for-over-3-hours-i-think-fromsoftware-can-actually-pull-off-this-roguelike-pivot/) and came away thinking that it feels like a mod in the best way possible. Can FromSoft pull off the roguelike pivot? We're certainly hopeful.

One news story you won't see tonight – for the first time, anyway – is that [Fromsoftware's Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign now has a release date](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-this-may-costs-usd40-and-already-has-dlc-cooking/) of May 30. Not only that, but the roguelike take on the Lands Between also has DLC in the works.

Here's hoping that the Lost Souls Aside devs were talking about the big showcase and not, uh, the death of Duolingo mascot that's currently going viral.

If you've been out of the loop, Lost Souls Aside was first revealed around nine years ago, though we found out last year that the Final Fantasy and Devil May Cry mash-up is finally due to release this year. It's been a wait, though one that seems to be drawing to a close. Check out the trailer below for the vibe.

Starting with a game that essentially seems confirmed to show up, it looks like we're finally getting another look at Lost Soul Aside. Fans were quick to notice that the developers retweeted the State of Play announcement, and while that doesn't mean too much, we then got a follow-up that made the tease somewhat more concrete.

The answer is « yes ».[February 11, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1889358173363945896)

And away we go! We've got many hours to go until the showcase itself, though that gives us plenty of time to get into some predictions and round up some rumors doin' the rounds.
