The unannounced Twisted Metal reboot was apparently a battle royale game that sounds an awful lot like [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/)'s other failed vehicular combat game Destruction All Stars.

Alongside [layoffs that affected roughly 900 employees last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/playstation-cancels-several-unannounced-projects-amid-heavy-layoffs-and-a-studio-closure-sometimes-great-ideas-dont-become-great-games/), Sony also reportedly scrapped a new Twisted Metal game that was said to have been in development at Firesprite Studios. The cult classic vehicular combat game hadn't received a new entry since 2012, so the reboot would've nicely slotted next to the ongoing TV series.

We now know roughly what Sony was planning with the revival, if details from a former developer's CV are to be believed. The ex-Firesprite developer said they were working on a "vehicular action combat game" that was "based on a classic IP owned by PlayStation." This particular reboot was apparently also going to let you out of the vehicles that most people play *vehicular *combat games for, and feature third-person shooting where the aim was to be the last player standing. So, every other battle royale but this time with Sweet Tooth? [Blurred screenshots](https://www.hugoflsilva.com/project/1) show the third-person cover shooting they were talking about, too.

Sony's live service push hasn't been going great. While Helldivers 2 was a galaxy-sized hit last year, [PlayStation's Concord was a historic flop](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/concord-is-officially-fully-permanently-dead-as-sony-announces-its-closing-the-failed-hero-shooters-studio-and-moving-on-we-will-take-the-lessons-learned/) and the publisher's since cancelled several multiplayer hopefuls, including The Last of Us Online and two unannounced games from the [Demon Souls and Days Gone studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/playstation/playstation-cancels-unannounced-live-service-god-of-war-game-from-demons-soul-remake-studio-and-live-service-game-from-days-gone-dev/) - one of which was said to be a God of War multiplayer game of some kind.

Former SIE exec Shuhei Yoshida recently said that [Playstation's never given its studios a live service mandate](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-last-of-us/cancelled-the-last-of-us-online-game-was-great-but-former-playstation-exec-says-naughty-dog-had-to-scrap-it-after-bungie-told-them-how-much-work-it-would-be/), but many of them know the chances of getting the thumbs up on a pitch are significantly higher if it includes online elements. One has to wonder if the mega-publisher would need to cancel so many games if it just, you know, let successful single-player teams make what they're good at.
