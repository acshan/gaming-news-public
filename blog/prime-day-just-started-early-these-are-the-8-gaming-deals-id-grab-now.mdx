Prime Day doesn't begin until tomorrow, but nobody seems to have told whoever's in charge of the gaming deals. Some eye-catching bargains have already started to creep out from cover, and we're still hours away from the official start date.

I've been covering sales like Prime Day for a long time, and there are *always *gaming deals that test my resolve not to give in and buy all the shiny things. This year already looks good so far as discounts go, so I've gathered a handful that I think are particularly enticing.

For a better look at the sale as a whole, don't miss our guide to the full [Prime Day gaming deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/prime-day-gaming-deals/) - it's regularly updated with all the latest offers.

MTG Fallout Scrappy Survivors Commander Deck | [$60 $44.99 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FMagic-Gathering-Commander-Survivors-Accessories%2Fdp%2FB0CKD85XVG%2F%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-5882079968662173145-20)
*Save $25 - *I missed out on the Fallout crossover in Magic: The Gathering earlier this year, so have been keeping an eye out in case a discount on Commander decks ever appeared. Lo and behold, a reduction on the Dogmeat deck entered the ring ahead of Prime Day. This deck has only ever been a few dollars cheaper, and that was eight months ago - it's stubbornly hovered around the $56-mark ever since. As such, this is a pretty noteworthy offer.

Buy it if: 
✅ You love Fallout
✅ You already play MTG
✅ Commander is your format

Don't buy it if: 
❌ You're completely new to MTG
❌ You've always preferred the bad guys

*Save $30* - I'm endlessly struggling for storage space on my PS5, so now I'm seriously considering an SSD. I've always resisted that temptation because they can be pretty spenny, but this Prime Day offer brings one of the most reliable options down to a reasonable level. It's not a record low price or anything, but seeing how poor SSD deals have been this year, it's probably the best I'll get until Black Friday. 

Buy it if: 
✅ You need more storage space
✅ You want very fast loading times
✅ 1TB is enough

Don't buy it if: 
❌ You don't need a heatsink
❌ You need more storage than 1TB

*Save $25 - *I've been a massive Prince of Persia fan since Sands of Time back in 2003, but I've yet to dive into the franchise's latest entry. This Prime Day deal presents my best opportunity, because it offers a return to the game's record low price.

Buy it if:

✅ You enjoy Metroidvanias
✅ You love a good puzzle

Don't buy it if:

*Save $70* - Yes, I know this isn't an Amazon Prime deal. But it just goes to show that you shouldn't ignore other retailers during the sale, as they normally get involved with big discounts of their own. This is also the lowest price our team of bargain-hunters has been able to find on the new and improved headset this week. Because I'm a huge fan of VR and am looking enviously at the Meta Quest 3-only games on the horizon (like Batman: Arkham Shadow), so this would be at the top of my list this Prime Day.

Buy it if: 
✅ You want accessible VR
✅ You're OK with 12GB storage
✅ You're interested in mixed reality

Don't buy it if: 
❌ You're happy with the Quest 2
❌ You're not convinced it isn't a fad
