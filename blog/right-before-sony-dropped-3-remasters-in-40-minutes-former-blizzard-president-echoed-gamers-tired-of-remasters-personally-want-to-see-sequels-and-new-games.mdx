Former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has called for fewer game remasters in favor of more new experiences.

In a tweet ahead of the [PlayStation State of Play](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/playstation-state-of-play/) last night, Ybarra said that he was "hoping we don't see a lot of remasters continuing across the industry." Ybarra's comments were attached to a picture of Days Gone, remaster rumors of which were circling ahead of last night's event despite its 2019 release. That rumor wasn't proven true last night, but the leaked [Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was unveiled](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horizon/horizon-zero-dawns-remaster-is-real-and-it-improves-the-open-world-game-to-match-the-visuals-of-its-sequel/) in its place, along with several other remaster projects, including [Lunar](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/after-25-years-two-classic-jrpgs-are-coming-back-to-life-with-the-definitive-lunar-remastered-collection-out-this-spring/) and [Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-the-cult-classic-m-rated-zelda-like-from-the-tomb-raider-devs-is-finally-getting-its-remaster-according-to-rogue-playstation-store-listing/).

Hoping we donâ€™t see a lot of remasters continuing across the industry. I get some enjoy them, but personally want to see sequels and new games/worlds. https://t.co/dE9a4OXelD[September 24, 2024](https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1838535617593872724)

Ybarra goes on to explain that while "I get some [people] enjoy" remasters, he'd "personally want to see sequels and new games/worlds." There's a definite sense across the industry that getting new IP off the ground is a risky proposition right now, and [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/)'s push for live-service multiplayer has also led to several studios squeezing their successful catalogues harder than ever. Sony's remaster strategy has come under particular fire, with repeated re-releases swelling the ranks of [Naughty Dog](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/naughty-dog/) and [Insomniac](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/insomniac-games/)'s release schedules in particular.

This isn't the first time Ybarra has weighed in on the industry this month, although last time he was a little further in Sony's corner. In the wake of the [PS5 Pro](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-pro-guide/) unveiling, the [former Blizzard president jumped to Sony's defense over the PS5 Pro's $700 price tag](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/ps5/former-blizzard-boss-says-the-dollar700-ps5-pro-is-really-more-like-a-dollar350-upgrade-because-its-aimed-at-people-who-can-trade-in-their-ps5s-at-places-like-gamestop/), suggesting that it's not all that bad - you can just trade in your current PS5, so the real price is only $350.
