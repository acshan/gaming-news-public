Dustborn, a brand new action-adventure focused on narrative choices and the power of words, just got a brand new gameplay trailer at the Future Games Show Summer Showcase. 

Originally debuting back in our very first [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) back in 2020, the latest trailer lets us know that you can pre-order the game right now. Dustborn is dropping on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and PC on August 20. 

In Dustborn, you'll be trekking across an alt-history America with a stolen package and your rag-tag crew. You play as Pax, an exile and con-artist with the power of weaponizing language. 

Accompanied by a group of her friends, Pax must work as an undercover punk-rock band as they traverse the Divided States of the America. They all have their own powers and personalities that you'll have to navigate as you work together to make it where you need to go. 

With Pax able to weaponize words, you'll have to choose what you say carefully. Branching dialogue options will shape the way you experience Dustborn, so you'll want to take your time to explore, investigate, and chat - but also really think about how you use words against your friends and your foes. 

The pre-order trailer gives us just a taste of how using different words could affect the outcome of a situation where the crew gets pulled over by the cops. With just this small interaction having several potential outcomes, I can't wait to see just how intricate this wordy web is.
