> Rockstar Games launched its first Discord server alongside a GTA Online Valentine's Day update, sparking fervent fan requests for GTA 6 trailers and details, highlighting the community's anticipation for the game's release.

Rockstar just revealed its [first Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames) along with [its Valentine's Day update](https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4kk8497a128421/celebrate-valentine-s-day-in-gta-online), and fans are wasting no time by acting coy. They're on the fast track to intimacy with Rockstar, demanding new [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/) trailers between things like discussing the best time to poop.

"Give us GTA 6 trailer 2," demands one Discord user.

"GTA 6 trailer 3 please," requests another.

"I save my poop for work so I can get paid for it," reports one wise thought leader.

"Will GTA 6 include removable shoes and socks?" someone else inquires.

Officially, Rockstar's Discord is meant to be an easy place to "keep up with the latest in [Rockstar Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/rockstar-games/) news," the developer writes in its update post.

"Whether you're coordinating with a Heist crew, organizing a car meet, or putting a team together to take advantage of this week's Casino Story Mission bonuses," Rockstar says, "there's no better place to connect with like-minded players than on the newly launched official Rockstar Games Discord."

But what Rockstar fails to understand – or perhaps, refuses to accept – is that the like-mindedness that brings their fans together comes from a shared evolutionary urge to play GTA 6, and to never stop dreaming about the GTA 6 release date.

That said, Rockstar's Discord also proves that GTA fans can enjoy short breaks from their all-consuming GTA desires, too. These much needed respites happen in the moments when fans are actually taking care of *themselves* for once, like by engaging in their hobbies and [posting text art](https://x.com/billsyliamgta/status/1889774067621798080) of Among Us characters with gigantic, erect penises.

"Hi @RockstarGames GTA 6. Give me GTA 6," one Discord user says.

"Are they adding footjobs to GTA 6," wonders another.

"WE NEED GTA 4 REMASTER BEFORE GTA 6 NO ONE WANTS GTA 6 WE ALL WANT GTA 4 REMASTERED!!!" counters another poster.

While GTA 6 does not yet have an official release date, I'm glad, at least, that Rockstar was able to reinvent the Socratic seminar through its new Discord server.
