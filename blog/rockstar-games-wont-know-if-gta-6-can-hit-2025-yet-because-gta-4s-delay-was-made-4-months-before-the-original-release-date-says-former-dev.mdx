Online rumors recently pushed the narrative that [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/) had already been internally delayed to 2026, but one former [Rockstar Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/rockstar-games/) lead has explained that the studio won't know whether the game needs more time in the oven until next summer.

Former Rockstar North technical director Obbe Vermeij has [chimed in](https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1835058223012893107) on the discourse to remind folks that "the decision to delay GTA 4 was made four months or so before the original release date. Any further and it's hard to make the call." GTA 6 still has another year in production, so Vermeij says that Rockstar "is probably not in a position to determine whether they will hit 2025 until May-ish."

He continues to explain that a delay is certainly on the table, however. Hype for GTA 6 has been building for over a decade at this point - and everyone from [industry analysts](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/analyst-says-gta-6s-importance-to-the-console-market-cannot-be-overstated-as-sony-and-microsoft-try-to-get-old-gen-players-to-upgrade/), [Xbox executives](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/with-fable-and-doom-the-dark-ages-coming-in-2025-xbox-lead-wants-to-avoid-the-elephant-in-the-room-many-are-going-to-plan-around-gta-6/), and [Take-Two's CEO](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/ceo-of-rockstar-owner-sizes-up-gta-6-the-worlds-in-a-different-place-than-it-was-when-we-launched-gta-5-and-the-sequel-could-be-unmatched-in-the-industry/) reckon the game could be a hit unlike any other - so the studio will likely choose to delay it until it's ready, rather than rush toward an underbaked and doomed-to-be-controversial launch.

"GTA 6 will sell for 10+ years and there is no competition to worry about," Vermeij continues. "They are not going to release the game until they're 100% happy with it. No matter what it said in the trailer. I have no inside info. Didn't talk to anyone."

Vermeij also thinks that parent company [Take-Two](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/take-two-interactive/) probably wouldn't force Rockstar's hand to make the studio release the game before it's fully ready. "Take-Two let Rockstar make their own decisions and I don't think there is any reason to change that now."
