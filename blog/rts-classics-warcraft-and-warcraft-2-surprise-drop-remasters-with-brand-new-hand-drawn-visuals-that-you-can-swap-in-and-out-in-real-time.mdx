Blizzard has surprise-dropped remasters for Warcraft and Warcraft 2.

[We had some inclination that 1995's Warcraft 2 was getting a remaster when it leaked last week](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/real-time-strategy/warcraft-2-remastered-has-apparently-leaked-and-i-sure-hope-its-more-diablo-2-resurrected-than-warcraft-3-reforged/), but the reveal of Warcraft 1: Remastered is a total surprise. Blizzard revealed both titles in a new trailer, showing off stark visual improvements from the original games. "These remasters feature brand new, hand-drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game," said Warcraft manager Brad Chan during [Blizzard's 30th anniversary livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivVybg9M7LM).

It's hard to say how the visual improvements will hold up in actual gameplay, but judging from the footage shown in the trailer, they look solid. I'll always have a fondness for the original look, which has such endearing grit, and for my money the new look is decidedly more cartoony, but I suspect newcomers may prefer the updated version.

Here's the good news. Chan also confirmed you'll be able to swap out the original graphics with the remastered versions, and vice-versa, at any point "in real time."

Here are some quick side-by-sides of the old, pixel-y versions next to their 2024 counterparts for comparison:

The remasters are up for sale individually today, with Warcraft 1 Remastered going for $9.99 and Warcraft 2 Remastered costing $14.99. They're also available as part of the $39.99 Warcraft Remastered Battle Chest, which includes both remasters as well as Warcraft 3: Reforged, which just got [its massive 2.0 update](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/pc-gaming/warcraft-3-reforged-was-so-bad-that-blizzard-changed-its-refund-policy-now-its-getting-a-second-chance-with-a-huge-2-0-update/) aimed at giving the maligned four-year-old remaster a new lease on life.
