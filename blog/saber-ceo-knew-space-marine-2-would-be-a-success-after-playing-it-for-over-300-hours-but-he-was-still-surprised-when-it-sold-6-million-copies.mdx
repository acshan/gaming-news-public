[Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/space-marine-2-guide/)turned out to be a massive success when it launched last year. So much so that Saber Interactive's CCO Tim Willits said it ["changes everything"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/space-marine-2-has-been-such-a-huge-success-that-it-changes-everything-for-its-developers-you-look-at-yourself-through-a-different-lens/) for the company and that it's the [fastest-selling game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/space-marine-2-boss-and-former-id-software-ceo-reckon-the-warhammer-hit-is-the-fastest-selling-game-weve-ever-worked-on-including-all-the-quake-doom-wolfenstein-and-rage-games/) he had ever worked on (including the likes of Doom and Wolfenstein). Fans loved its [Xbox 360 throwback ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/space-marine-2-developers-wanted-it-to-feel-like-a-xbox-360-throwback-shooter-but-didnt-know-it-was-that-obvious/)style, and no wonder it was almost refreshing in its oldness.

Even if many of us were surprised how well the game did as a sequel to a then 12-year-old game, Saber Interactive's CEO, Matt Karch, knew things would probably work out. Speaking to Stephen Totilo at [Game File ](https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-embracer-savvy-games-space-marine-russia)(paywalled), Karch said, “I knew Space Marine was going to do well.” He was sure of this because, “I was betting on something that I played. I played it for over 300 hours."

But just how big it would turn out did come as a surprise to the studio's CEO, with Karch later adding, "Did I know it was going to sell what ultimately is going to be over six million units this year? No. But I knew it would sell.” Having the Warhammer 40,000 series on board already gave the game an audience – not to mention the original Space Marine was a bit of a cult classic – but it turned out that Space Marine 2 had that secret sauce to make it the biggest Warhammer game ever, according to [SteamDB's charts](https://steamdb.info/charts/?tagid=12286). And things went so well that we've already had confirmation that [Space Marine 3 is on the way](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/warhammer-40-000-space-marine-3-is-in-development-following-the-explosive-success-of-space-marine-2-and-its-promising-even-bigger-battles/); there's no decade-long wait this time around (barring some mad delays).*Saber's CEO also spoke about the Saints Row series and *[<em>why it had to die</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/saber-interactive-ceo-says-saints-row-had-to-die-because-the-games-were-too-expensive-the-days-of-throwing-money-at-games-other-than-the-gtas-of-the-world-is-over/)* in his eyes, blaming the cost of making the game and the lack of direction on the 2022 reboot. *
