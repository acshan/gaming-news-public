One dedicated [<u>Grand Theft Auto</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-gta-games/) fan is sick of waiting for [<u>GTA 6</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/), so they've modded an interpretation of its map into [<u>GTA 5</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-5-guide/).

As spotted by [<u>VG247</u>](https://www.vg247.com/gta-6-map-gta-5-mod-done-and-released), YouTuber Dark Space shares a video detailing the map they've added to GTA 5 that's based on the snippets we saw in the [<u>GTA 6 trailer</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-trailer-1/). We got a glimpse of white sand beaches, luxurious beachfront properties, and some slightly more rural swampland, but Dark Space is quick to point out that this modded map contains a lot of speculation and is in no way official. Still, the map is to scale, so it's an interesting way to get a feel for how big GTA 6 may be.

It's also a very basic and bare map. A lot of the assets are ones repurposed from GTA 5, and there's no traffic or pedestrians roaming about either.

Regardless, "playing on this map will remind you how insane GTA 6 is gonna be," Dark Space says.

GTA 6 is set in Vice City, which is based on Miami. This new iteration of Vice City also includes some of Florida's iconic swamps, too. There were plenty of [<u>references to real-life events you may have missed</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-trailer-1-breakdown-things-you-missed/) in the GTA 6 trailer, like the Florida Joker. Dark Space has also added some funny billboards and real-life Miami art installations to their version of the map to make it feel a bit more believable.

If you want to try the map out for yourself, you'll need to join [<u>Dark Space's Discord server</u>](https://discord.com/invite/5R79ddS).

There's also an [<u>official modding tool that Rockstar has approved</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/despite-its-history-of-taking-action-against-gta-mods-a-rockstar-approved-gta-5-modding-tool-is-on-the-way-to-assist-the-modding-community-in-the-wake-of-the-recent-pc-upgrade/) to help make modding the [<u>new PC version of GTA</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-5-is-giving-pc-players-a-free-upgrade-that-brings-it-up-to-par-with-the-console-versions-and-adds-some-pc-exclusive-features/) even easier, so we may see even more mods like this in the future.
