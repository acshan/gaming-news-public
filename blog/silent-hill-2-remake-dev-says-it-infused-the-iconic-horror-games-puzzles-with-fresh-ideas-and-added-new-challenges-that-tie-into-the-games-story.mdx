[<u>Silent Hill 2</u> Remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/) studio Bloober Team has spoken on walking the tightrope between honoring an iconic game with a faithful remake and bringing something new to the table, specifically with regards to the puzzles.

In a new post from the official Bloober Team Twitter account, a video shows one of the game's many puzzles in action, with the caption reading: "In #SILENTHILL2, we’ve strived to recreate the game's iconic puzzles, while also infusing some of them with fresh ideas and adding new challenges that tie into the game's story."

Bloober Team also confirmed that the remake will have three different difficulty options for all of the puzzles in the game, which is a feature carried over from the original.

There's been an immense amount of pressure on Bloober Team to deliver a satisfying remake of one of the most iconic horror games of all time. Most of the horror community's trepidation is due to Bloober Team not being the original developer of the game, and also not necessarily having any one game fans can point to as proof of its ability to do the Silent Hill name justice. That's not to say it doesn't have any solid games - I personally really enjoyed The Medium - it's just that it's in the unenviable position of being compared to Silent Hill 2 of all games.

All that said, [hands-on previews](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/i-played-the-first-five-hours-of-the-silent-hill-2-remake-and-was-pleasantly-if-not-cautiously-surprised/) from August were almost unanimously positive and really shifted the tone and conversation around the remake considerably. The remake hits PS5 and PC on October 8.
