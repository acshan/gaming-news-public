Bloober Team had somewhat of a mixed reputation as a studio after putting out horror games that ranged from interesting but flawed experiences, to ones that were straight-up [memed to death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coqoGEOcxAA) for their odd quirks. But it's a reputation the developer seems to have shed with its excellent, recently-released [Silent Hill 2 remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-review/https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/), and the studio hopes to keep up its winning streak.

In an interview with [Gamespot](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/), the horror remake's co-directors acknowledged some of the sentiment behind their gameogrophy and how they're looking to build on what worked in Silent Hill 2 remake. "We want to find our niche, and we think we found our niche, so now we just - let's evolve with it," co-director Jacek Zieba said.

"And how that happens is more complex, but it also happens organically in a way, like with Layers of Fear [2016], people in the studio were like, 'Okay, we made some shitty games before, but we [can] evolve," he continued.

Co-director Wojciech Piejko added that Bloober Team is a studio that's attracted a "team that loves horror," and even though they could, theoretically, move into other genres, "we don't want to." 

Bloober Team's previous work - from Layers of Fear, The Medium, and even its Blair Witch adaptation - all showed promise, but were often held back by wonky gameplay or plainly nonsensical stories. Silent Hill 2 remake, on the other hand, is easily the company's best received, [best reviewed](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-review/) game of all time with an atmosphere dripping in dread and combat that stands tall alongside some of the genre's best.

It's a combo that Bloober Team is hoping to keep up in its next game, the newly-unveiled [Cronos: The New Dawn, which looks like a fun take on a sci-fi nightmare](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/riding-high-on-the-silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-reveals-an-original-survival-horror-ip-that-looks-like-a-fun-sci-fi-nightmare/) that's coming to PC, Xbox, and PS5 next year.
