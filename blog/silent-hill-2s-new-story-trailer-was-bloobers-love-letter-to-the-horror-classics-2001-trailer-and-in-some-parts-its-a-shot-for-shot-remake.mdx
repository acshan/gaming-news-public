[Silent Hill 2 remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/)'s brand new story trailer was designed to be a "love letter" to the horror game's original 2001 trailer.

Just earlier today, [Konami](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/konami/) released a brand new story-oriented trailer for Silent Hill 2 remake, which you can see in full just below. The trailer opens with protagonist James Sunderland's wife, Maria, speaking to him from within a jail cell, and focuses on his other interactions with supporting characters within the titular town, including Eddie.

It turns out this trailer was designed to be developer Bloober Team's "love letter" to the original Silent Hill 2 trailer from all the way back in 2001. That's according to Bloober Team creative director and lead designer, Mateusz Lenart, writing on Twitter, praising Konami for collaborating with Bloober Team on the trailer. "I think it captures the mood of the game pretty well," Lenart adds.

I really love this one! ❤️ We wanted to create something that will be a love letter to the OG trailer from 2001 which also focuses on Maria in the cell. We expanded on that idea and created the entire composition of the video around that scene, which. in my opinion, was a… https://t.co/gVCcBgReWk[August 19, 2024](https://twitter.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825434283189600377)

The trailer Lenart is referencing is the one seen just below, and watching the two side by side, they're incredibly alike. The trailer opens with the same monologue from Maria, before cutting to James' found footage-style film of Maria within the hotel. The trailer even opens with the same few guitar notes, and later features James confronting Eddie about why he can't kill people.

One could even argue that the 2001 trailer is more action-packed than the new trailer for Bloober Team's remake. A common criticism of Silent Hill 2 remake trailers over the past year is that they've focused too much on action, but the new trailer merely features James stalking around the town, while the 2001 trailer has him both killing monsters and being killed by monsters.

We just recently went hands-on with Konami and Bloober Team's remake, and for more on why it's looking more impressive than ever before, read up on our complete [Silent Hill 2 remake preview](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/i-played-the-first-five-hours-of-the-silent-hill-2-remake-and-was-pleasantly-if-not-cautiously-surprised/).
