[Silent Hill f](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill-f-guide/)'s director has shed some light on the game's Otherworld segments, saying that the team wanted a "blend of new and nostalgic."

There have been a lot of different interpretations of Silent Hill at this point, but – barring Ascension and The Short Message – they've all had one thing in common: actually taking place in Silent Hill, Maine (the titular Book of Memories was sent from Silent Hill, I'm counting it). But Silent Hill f is breaking that trend; this time around it's taking place in 1960s Japan in a town called Ebisugaoka (which is based on a town that can be[ just as spooky, according to the locals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/japanese-locals-show-that-the-real-world-inspiration-for-silent-hill-fs-new-town-can-be-just-as-scary-as-the-game/)).

And of course, there's another layer to Silent Hill; at some point or another, the protagonist will wander into the Otherworld. This is a part of Silent Hill that can reflect the psyche of whoever inhabits it (most famously it's a rusty and bloody mess in the original game). This time around, the Otherworld takes place in a place called 'The Dark Shrine,' we didn't get to see much of it in [the recent trailer](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/new-silent-hill-f-reveal-trailer-shows-some-of-the-freakiest-monsters-ive-ever-seen-in-the-25-year-old-survival-horror-series/), although it was home to a horrific doll monster.

[Konami](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/konami/) made a new post on the [Silent Hill Twitter account](https://x.com/SilentHill/status/1905998469942198597) showing off The Dark Shrine in all its glory. While this isn't exactly a big deal, Silent Hill f's director, Al Yang, chimed in with some more details about the new Otherworld. In a [post on Twitter,](https://x.com/QQBert/status/1906562624856130033) Yang said, "One of the big challenges for us on SILENT HILL f was to create an interesting Otherworld for our new setting." Afterwards, Yang dug a little deeper into the philosophy behind the design, saying that NeoBards wanted to find "that blend of new and nostalgic."

Of course, details on just what Silent Hill f has in store are still being held close to Konami's chest. But considering the game has already been [rated by the ESRB](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-fs-esrb-rating-has-zero-chill-faces-ripped-apart-a-character-burned-alive-inside-a-cage-and-entrails-and-sinew-displayed-on-serving-platters/) and CERO (making it the first game in the series to be[ rated 18+ in Japan](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-f-may-be-the-scariest-game-in-the-26-year-old-series-or-at-least-the-first-one-rated-18-in-japan/)), it's likely we'll find out more in the near future.
