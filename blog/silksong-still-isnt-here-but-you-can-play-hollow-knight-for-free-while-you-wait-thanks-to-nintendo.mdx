[<u>Hollow Knight: Silksong</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-silksong-guide/) isn't here just yet, but members of Nintendo Switch Online can now enjoy Team Cherry's first game in full - entirely for free.

No, Silksong isn't out and no, there's no news (as of now) regarding its release. However, the original Hollow Knight title is available to play for free from now until June 12 - as long as you have a Nintendo Switch Online membership. In a surprise announcement earlier today, Nintendo revealed that "members can play the full game for free now" via its Game Trial. While the free period itself is limited, there's a longer-lasting 50% [<u>discount</u>](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Hollow-Knight-1125772.html?&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=NintendoSwitchOnline%7CNSOHollowKnightGTStarts%7Cm_id_KPqzz8m2KQ%7C1125772#) on Hollow Knight up until June 19, too.

Considering the timing of both the free trial and hefty sale as the [<u>Summer Game Fest</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/summer-game-fest-schedule-2024/) looms just over the horizon, hopeful fans are wondering whether or not Nintendo's surprise reveal could mean that a bigger one is coming - about Silksong, of course. "Interesting timing just before SGF," one excited comment speculates. "I'm telling you it's coming." Others question whether or not the deal is "a sign" of possible Silksong news to come. "Is this the signal?"

Unfortunately, there's no formal indication that we'll see Hollow Knight's long-awaited sequel make an appearance at any upcoming showcase - but we can hope to nonetheless. It has been a whole five years since Team Cherry first announced the Metroidvania, after all. [<u>Silksong is going to be available day one on Game Pass</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-e3-2022-trailer/), so we might just catch a glimpse of it during the [<u>Xbox Games Showcase</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/xbox-game-showcase-2024-predictions-summer-game-fest/) this weekend if the stars align.
