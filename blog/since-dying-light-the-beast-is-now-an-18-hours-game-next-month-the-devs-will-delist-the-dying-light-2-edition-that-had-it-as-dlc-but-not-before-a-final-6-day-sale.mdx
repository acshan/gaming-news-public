Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition was originally meant to give players two major pieces of story DLC, but now that the second DLC pack has expanded into Dying Light: The Beast - a full, standalone game - the devs are planning to delist the bundle.

"While we were developing Dying Light: The Beast it has outgrown its original scope," developer Techland explains in a [tweet](https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1827005260440756277). "We're now delivering a full 18+ hours standalone adventure instead of just a DLC. We will be honoring our promise to our long-time supporters and deliver Dying Light: The Beast to current Ultimate owners at no extra cost - but due to the increased scope, we will stop selling it in the future."

Both the full Dying Light 2: Ultimate Edition bundle and the Ultimate Upgrade will remain available until September 30, and Techland will honor all owners of either version by giving them a copy of The Beast. If you've never picked up Dying Light 2 before, you might be interested in the current 30% off sale on the Ultimate Edition bundle, which brings the price down to $62.99 on both Steam and PlayStation – quite possibly the last sale this edition will see. Not bad for a full game, some DLC, and a big ol' DLC-pack-turned-spinoff.

As we learned at Gamescom, [The Beast's transition from DLC to full game was in part inspired by a leak from the "very eager community."](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/dying-light-the-beast-started-off-as-dying-light-2-dlc-but-became-a-whole-new-game-after-the-very-eager-community-leaked-critical-story-details/) The dev meeting that followed ended up settling on the idea to bring back Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original game. While the devs have confirmed in an [FAQ](https://dyinglightgame.com/the-beast) that Dying Light 2 won't be getting a second story expansion now, they've committed to fulfilling their [promise of five years of support for the zombie parkour game](https://www.gamesradar.com/dying-light-2-guarantees-to-expand-the-world-for-at-least-five-years-post-launch/).
