Over a decade has passed since [<u>Bethesda Game Studios</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bethesda-game-studios/) blessed us with [<u>Skyrim</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/skyrim-guide/), arguably the company's most iconic RPG to date - and players evidently are still not sick of it, judging by the Special Edition's downloads on Nexus Mods.

[<u>Skyrim mods</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-skyrim-mods/) aren't going anywhere, it seems, and Nexus Mods serves as proof. The platform for sharing and downloading user-created mods for games is iconic to fans of Elder Scrolls titles and other big RPGs, ranging from [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) to [<u>The Witcher 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-3-guide/). Of all the games with mods on Nexus, however, there's one that downright dominates - and it's none other than Skyrim's 2016 Special Edition.

According to Nexus Mods' own [<u>data</u>](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/stats/#display=downloads&min=1701814184901&max=1733436584901&bh=ignore) (highlighted via [<u>Soanfriwack on Reddit</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1h7lhp4/skyrim_se_is_65_of_all_nexus_mod_downloads/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*)*, November saw around 393 million mod downloads in total. Of these almost 400 million downloads, Skyrim Special Edition took up a whopping 255 million - that means that just under 65% of all mods downloaded from the Nexus were for Bethesda's revamped RPG. In other words, the Special Edition accounted for a wild two-thirds or so of Nexus Mods' ever-growing traffic.

Considering how many other games' mods are available, these figures are mind-boggling. Bethesda takes up a massive lion's share of downloads - by the time you add Fallout, Oblivion, and OG Skyrim, you're looking at a full 74% of all the mods installed last month. Soanfriwack points out that the only other "significant" games taking up that remaining 26% are Baldur's Gate 3, [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-guide/), and Stardew Valley.

As a Skyrim stan myself, though, I doubt those figures will change any time soon. [The Elder Scrolls 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-location-news-races/) is still likely quite a long while away from arriving, and creative modders are constantly uploading new downloads on Nexus' website. Just today, I can see 90 new mods have been posted with almost 500 across the week thus far.Â
