Even after devoting 14 years of his career to Bethesda, Skyrim senior artist [<u>Nate Purkeypile</u>](https://x.com/NPurkeypile) says the developer has changed too much for his tastes, and he would never return. 

"I can pretty safely say there's not a single day that I've even contemplated going back," Purkeypile told Bloomberg in [<u>a new interview</u>](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-30/after-era-of-bloat-veteran-video-game-developers-are-going-smaller) – one of many developers commenting on the freedom and agility that small teams offer in the face of AAA giants. "That scale of production is not necessarily enjoyable for a lot of people. You're very much a cog in the machine."

Things got too overwhelming while he worked as a lead artist on [<u>Starfield</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/starfield/), Bethesda's intergalactic epic with 1,000 planets and a credits sequence that lasts 45 minutes. To be a part of Starfield, Purkeypile had to attend over 20 meetings a week, Bloomberg reports. 

This was a very different Bethesda than the one Purkeypile first joined. While working on Skyrim, Purkeypile's fellow development team was under 100 people — a record for Bethesda at the time – who still made landmark games like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Purkeypile has said in [other interviews](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/there-were-so-many-meetings-a-former-bethesda-developer-explains-why-he-quit-during-starfield-and-started-a-solo-project/) that, in comparison, Starfield was made by approximately 500 Bethesda developers.

"I think the best stuff that came out of those games came out of trusting people," Purkeypile says. "To do that, I think you need a smaller, more intimate team."

Missing that closeness, Purkeypile abandoned ship in 2021. Since then, he's scaled down significantly, from Bethesda's hundreds of developers to just one. As one-man studio Just Purkey Games, Purkeypile recently released "heavy metal horror game" [<u>The Axis Unseen</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1807810/The_Axis_Unseen/). It's not as massive as Starfield, but few things need to be.
