Discussions about [Game Pass](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-game-pass/) typically revolve around the big titles like [Black Ops 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-loadouts/), Starfield and more, but one solo dev has detailed why the service is such a good thing for indie games like theirs. 

During a recent [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1h12664/ama_im_solo_developer_tomas_sala_creator_of_the/), Thomas Sala, the solo developer behind indie gems [The Falconeer](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-falconeer-review/) and Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles, was asked to give his opinion on Xbox's Game Pass model. The Falconeer, Sala's first title, made its way onto Game Pass around a year after its initial release, and thanks to the attention it garnered there, he [would love](https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1h12664/comment/lzaoc8x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to be featured on the service again. 

"I'd be on Game Pass the moment they could fit me in, no questions asked," Sala begins. "Falconeer did about a million installs on Game Pass." He goes on to explain that, for him, making games is not about the money, and Game Pass was a great way for him to reach a new audience. "I'm a dev, I fucking want players, [I] don't care about the money, let folks play!"

Unfortunately, as Sala notes, getting your game onto Game Pass is not in the hands of developers or publishers, explaining that "[Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) carefully curates Game Pass with a regular release cadence. If your game fits the schedule and meets expectations and you have signalled you're open to making a deal, Microsoft might offer you a slot."

That being said, Sala is still positive about the service and believes that for developers lucky enough to be given a slot, it can be hugely beneficial. "These things are up to the gods in Redmond and if you get in it's generally a very positive thing for a dev, especially in indie. They are more than fair in compensation and you get a huge audience."
