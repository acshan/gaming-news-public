Saber Interactive has a good reason behind why [<u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/within-10-minutes-of-killing-tyranids-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-become-my-most-anticipated-shooter-of-2024/) is only getting three-player co-op - the Space Marines are simply way too OP.

Speaking in an interview with [<u>PC Gamer</u>](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/space-marine-2-settled-on-3-player-co-op-because-having-4-lore-accurate-40k-marines-made-it-a-massacre/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com), brand and creative manager Yann François reveals just how powerful Space Marines truly are. "When you are reading about Space Marines," he explains, "Ultramarines and Primaris - you discover that they're superhuman on a really crazy scale. They measure up to [two to three] meters, they have two or three hearts functioning."

With two hearts, three lungs, and a powerhouse for a body, more than three Space Marines at a time in co-op mode wouldn't balance all that well. François says that developers actually tested out a four-person version, but it didn't work - Space Marine 2 ended up being way too easy."[It] was quite a challenge for the team to say: 'OK, [Space Marines] are almost invincible. How do we create a challenge around it?'"

François continues, detailing the "massacre" that occurred during the trialed four-player mode: "Because it could be super easy … That is what led to the choice of creating a multiplayer of up to three players. Because many people asked 'why is it not up to four players?' They tried it, and they realized it was too easy … it was a massacre. So three was a good number."

Considering the fact that Space Marines have bioengineered organs, the height of a giant, and the ability to stay awake while half their brain sleeps, I'd personally say that three-player co-op is more than fair. It's exciting to see how true to the lore Space Marine 2 is staying, too - sure, the devs could've adjusted things to allow for more players at once, but keeping the superhuman Space Marine abilities intact is the way to go.
