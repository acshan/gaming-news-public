If you'd been holding out hope for [Spider-Man 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-spider-man-2-guide/) DLC, you might want to let out the breath you've been keeping in. Buried in the announcement of the game's new PC port, developer [Insomniac](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/insomniac-games/) has confirmed that no more story content is planned.

"While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2," the devs say in the [announcement blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/18/marvels-spider-man-2-arrives-on-pc-january-2025/), "we’re delighted to bring all of our previously released post-launch content to the PC version, including New Game+, new suits and color variants, Photo Mode features, and more."

That's pretty surprising given that players had [uncovered what looked like story DLC plans when one patch accidentally left the game's debug menu accessible](https://www.gamesradar.com/spider-man-2-ps5-patch-accidentally-lets-players-view-dev-menu-revealing-dlc-plans-fans-call-it-the-best-part-of-the-update-as-insomniac-warns-it-could-corrupt-saves/). There's also the fact that there's a pretty obvious tease - one I won't spoil just in case you haven't yet finished Spider-Man 2 - for the appearance of a notable villain in one of the game's major side stories. Of course, it's entirely possible a lot of planning got turned upside-down when those [Insomniac leaks happened last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/games-industry-reacts-as-insomniacs-decade-long-plans-for-marvels-wolverine-spider-man-and-more-leak-truly-disgraceful-and-shameful/).

What we *are* getting is a PC port of Spider-Man 2, due out on January 30 across both Steam and the [Epic Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/epic-games/) Store. There's a fresh trailer you can see below, but if spoilers are a concern you might want to steer clear - the video shows a surprising amount of late-game story content you might wanna go into fresh.

"Our amazing partners at Nixxes have once again done an incredible job bringing the world of Marvel’s Spider-Man to PC players," Insomniac's core technology director Mike Fitzgerald says in the announcement. "Our team put a lot of love into this game, and we’re excited that it will soon be enjoyed by a whole new audience with keyboard and mouse controls, ultra widescreen support, and numerous graphical options that make it feel at home on their platform." The game also features "enhanced ray-tracing options" on PC.
