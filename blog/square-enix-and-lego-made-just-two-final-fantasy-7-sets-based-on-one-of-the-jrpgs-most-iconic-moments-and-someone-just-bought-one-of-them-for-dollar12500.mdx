[<u>Square Enix</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) partnered with [Lego](https://www.gamesradar.com/lego/) to create a special set based on a fan-voted beloved moment from [<u>Final Fantasy 7</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7/) - and one of the two they made just sold for literal thousands.

In January, [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) had [<u>Final Fantasy</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/final-fantasy/) fans choose one scene from the seventh game for a special Lego set - and players picked the one in which Aerith and Cloud meet for the second time within the Sector 5 slums' church. The result was two stunning sets, each over 40 inches tall and almost 30 inches wide. One was gifted by Square Enix to a very lucky fan following a giveaway event, while the other was spotted in-office by Remake and Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi.

It's likely that the second one stayed with Square Enix then, while the first has made its way around the world since - most recently onto the Heritage Auctions [<u>website</u>](https://comics.ha.com/itm/memorabilia/trading-cards/final-fantasy-vii-lego-set-diorama-cloud-strife-and-aerith-gainsborough-in-the-sector-5-slums-square-enix-2023-/a/7378-28102.s) where it sold for a mind-boggling amount. $12,500, to be precise - and any super stans looking to snag it now can offer its new owner $16,250 or more for a chance at obtaining it. That's a lot of money - but judging by the price that was already paid, the community is willing to pay quite a pretty penny.

There's no telling where the Lego set will land in the end - I'm just sad it's not on one of my own shelves. As much as I personally wish an official Final Fantasy-themed Lego set would hit the public market (for less than $12,500, preferably), I doubt it'll happen any time soon. At least I have the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake to look forward to - a game that's set to [<u>"beat any expectation you have,"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-beat-any-expectation-you-have-says-rebirth-director/) according to lead Hamaguchi himself.
