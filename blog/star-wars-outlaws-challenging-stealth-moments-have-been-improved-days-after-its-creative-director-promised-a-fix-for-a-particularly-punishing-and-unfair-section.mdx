A new patch is live for [<u>Star Wars Outlaws</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/), bringing with it a whole host of improvements, including for some brutal stealth sections that creative director Julian Gerighty previously promised a fix for. 

Last week, in an interview with GamesRadar+, Gerighty pointed to "one of the early missions in Mirogana" as [an "incredibly punishing" section](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/) that he believed was "a mistake" that the team would work to improve. He said that it "wasn't our intention" to make it feel unfair – and at the time, he thought it was. Now, though, as of version 1.1.2, it sounds like those issues have been ironed out. 

As well as implementing cross-progression and saving via [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) Connect, the latest update rolls out "tweaks and improvement on some challenging stealth moments." Additionally to this, you can now expect to be a bit stealthier while rolling around, as you're now "less likely to be detected" while doing so. Depending on the location you're in, "level of detection" has also been adjusted. 

The [<u>patch notes</u>](https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/221109/864200/12050?subId1=grd-us-6736046132905264581&sharedId=grd-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-sg%2Fgame%2Fstar-wars%2Foutlaws%2Fnews-updates%2FPCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser) don't list all the sections and locations affected by these changes, although they do mention that one quest in Toshara (which I won't name here for spoilers, but Ubisoft has listed) has had its NPC numbers adjusted and new environmental guidance markers added "to better facilitate infiltration."

The open-world adventure's "poor stealth systems" were initially one of the few faults in our [Star Wars Outlaws review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-review/), so it's great to see improvements made to certain sneaky sections. Hopefully, the changes will be enough to make those instant-fail moments feel less frustrating.
