There's still one more piece of DLC on the horizon for [Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/), and [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) has officially confirmed that it's going to be revealed as part of Star Wars Celebration Japan this month. In the meantime, there's a little teaser image to set the stage.

"Tune in to get a first glimpse at what’s next for Star Wars Outlaws," Ubisoft says in a tweet. "Join us on April 18th at Star Wars Celebration to learn more." Attached is a poster image for the new DLC, showcasing Hondo Ohnaka in all his questionable glory as well as a series of starfighters apparently chasing a small escape pod.

The DLC's title, A Pirate's Fortune, and a small plot description [were first revealed last year](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-roadmap-revealed-and-the-best-part-may-be-the-return-of-a-fan-favorite-who-dominated-the-beloved-clone-wars-and-rebels-animated-series/): "The Trailblazer’s reputation precedes Kay as she runs into veteran pirate Hondo Ohnaka, who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates." This teaser image is the first major update we've gotten on the expansion since. Ohnaka was a regular presence throughout the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, and has long been a favorite among fans.

A Pirate's Fortune was listed for a "spring 2025" release in the last roadmap. The previous DLC, Wild Card, offered a fun little side story quite different from anything the main game, and I'm hopeful this second expansion can do the same – though I do have my fingers crossed for something a bit meatier this time around. We'll find out more soon enough.
