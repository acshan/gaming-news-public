Now that the Star Wars Outlaws release time for Early Access has come and gone, the countdown to the full release is on.

[Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s open-world take on a galaxy far, far away lets us live out a Han Solo-like scoundrel fantasy as Kay Vess. Set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, expect plenty of hi-jinks as you become content with plenty of infamous factions who change their view of you depending on the relationship you maintain with them. And yes, you'll bump into Jabba the Hut on the way.

We've played Ubisoft's latest ourselves, and in our [Star Wars Outlaws review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-review/), we called it "an exceedingly fun Star Wars game that's hindered by poor stealth systems."

"[Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/) is an exceedingly fun Star Wars game that's hindered by poor stealth systems and lackluster mission design," we said. "Massive Entertainment establishes an incredible sense of place through its open worlds, accurately capturing the look and feel of the original trilogy of movies, but the experience falters the closer you stick to the critical path. If you've ever dreamed of becoming a scoundrel in a galaxy far, far away then you'll find a lot to like in Outlaws, and a lot more crawling through cramped ventilation systems than expected."

And there's not much time to play the game yourself. Star Wars Outlaws is available to pre-load now and is already out in Early Access. You can dive in if you bought or pre-ordered the Gold or Ultimate editions. If you're waiting for the full release, read on to find out when Star Wars Outlaws releases in your time zone on August 29 or 30.



While the Star Wars Outlaws release time on PC slightly varies depending on where you're in the world, the console unlock schedule is more uniform. You're good to go when midnight hits and August 29 turns to August 30. If you're in any doubt, check the graphic above.
