The talented creator behind the massive new [<u>Stardew Valley</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/stardew-valley-guide/) mod that turns ConcernedApe's farming sim into [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) isn't done with it just yet â€“ and their in-game hours prove just how dedicated they are.

Baldur's Village, as the mod is aptly dubbed on [<u>Nexus Mods</u>](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888), acts as a fan-created expansion, bringing a bit of the Baldur's Gate 3 world and its inhabitants to Stardew Valley. While it only released a few days ago, it managed to catch the attention and [<u>approval of Larian lead Swen Vincke</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/baldurs-gate-3-director-swen-vincke-gives-his-official-approval-to-the-stardew-valley-mod-that-brings-the-d-and-d-rpg-to-pelican-town/) himself, as well as almost 20,000 downloads â€“ and according to creator Xun, there's more to come for Baldur's Village and its fans yet.

Showing off their total in-game hours in Stardew Valley in a recent [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1899547388102000824), Xun reveals that the mod is still in the works with improvements to follow in the future.

"I wanna show you guys my playtime," they write. "I've been playing Stardew Valley since the day it was released, and now we finally have our own mod. So happy that such people like it, and we will continue to improve it even though our lives are really busy."

It's exciting, to say the least, as Baldur's Village is already massive, featuring six locations, more than 20 characters, dynamic events, various shops with unique items â€“ and most importantly, romanceable [<u>Baldur's Gate 3 companions</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-companions-party/) like Astarion. It already rivals some of the [<u>best Stardew Valley mods</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-stardew-valley-mods/) in sheer size, and there's no telling how it'll continue to expand as Xun brings more of the Forgotten Realms to Pelican Town.*Craving more farm sim shenanigans?
