Bethesda has finally revealed [Starfield's Shattered Space DLC](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/starfield-shattered-space/) release date, and it's not far off. 

As part of Opening Night Live, we get a new trailer revealing that the space RPG's first expansion will be released on September 30, just over a month from now. 

The trailer is a moody glimpse of what's to come, showcasing several quick shots of a mysterious and gloomy planet with a base and a threat that seems not too friendly at all, judging by the scream we get, anyway. 

Here's the story teaser from Bethesda: "The home planet of House Va’ruun remains a mystery to the vast majority of the citizens of the Settled Systems. This clandestine faction is primarily known only by their dangerous reputation and violent history. When a distress signal originating from a derelict star station leads you on a path to Va’ruun’kai, you’ll begin to uncover the secrets surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent and ultimately decide the future of House Va’ruun."

Bethesda rounds off by saying the RPG's first story expansion takes us to a brand new, "completely handcrafted location" to figure out what the deal is with House Va'ruun.

While Shattered Space is only one month away, you've got some new content to keep you going until then. Launching tonight, you get a [free vehicle update that includes the Rev-8 Buggy](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/starfields-rev-8-update-brings-the-first-ever-drivable-land-vehicle-to-a-bethesda-rpg-and-i-kind-of-want-to-play-starfield-now/), complete with new weapons, rocket thrusters, and jump boosters. We see the same buggy in the DLC trailer, so it may be useful for fleeing from the odd menace or two.
