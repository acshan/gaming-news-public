Starship Troopers: Extermination just showed off its bug-stacking, carnage-filled new update at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Summer Showcase.

In a new trailer, project lead Peter Maurice introduced Starship Troopers: Extermination's 0.8.0 update. Dubbed Carnage of Planet X-11, the new update will take you to its titular-location, nestled mysteriously among the rings of a gas giant. Once you get there, you'll be met with the all-new Carnage system, which allows for the bodies of the bugs you've slain to remain in place as long as you can survive.

It's all part of an attempt to remain more true to the cult-classic movie that Extermination is based on - Starship Troopers. In a real bug-war, the corpses of your fallen foes won't gradually dissolve away as the battle goes on, so why should they do that in a virtual war? The result is piles of ex-bugs mounting ever higher as the assault goes on, requiring you to adapt to the battlefield as it changes with each foe that falls.

Elsewhere in the update is that new planet. X-11 is home to a powerful listening array that it's your job to defend, and in doing so you'll contend with the game's first joint indoor/outdoor map as the fight goes on. There's also new bug armor, which makes your opponents a little harder to kill - unless you know where to aim to take them down with their new weak points.

Starship Troopers: Extermination is currently available in early access on Steam.
