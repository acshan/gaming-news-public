The action and bombast of the 1997 movie was just the start - Starship Troopers: Extermination brings the world of Paul Verhoeven's cult classic to life like never before, turning you and your allies into boots on the ground in a relentless effort to keep humanity safe.

Starship Troopers: Extermination is a huge strategic FPS, putting you and up to 15 co-op partners against never-ending hordes of bugs. In order to effectively bring the fight to your opponents, you'll have to work as part of a crack team to establish a foothold on these bug planets. As you battle across massive maps, you'll also have to work to recapture and rebuild fallen bases to take control of the planet - and hold it.

Those bugs, however, will throw everything they've got at you, resulting in battles that can find you facing down against hundreds of enemies on-screen at the same moment. Your mastery of your trusty Morita Assault Rifle and any one of Starship Troopers: Extermination's six classes - from the destructive Demolisher to the long-distance Sniper to the crucial Medic - could be all that makes the difference between victory and defeat.

Of course, you'll also have your allies at your back, and if you can work together effectively, you can turn back wave after wave of incoming bugs. Starship Troopers: Extermination's unique Carnage system means that the bodies of the Arachnids you kill remains on the battlefield after you kill them, meaning that effective strategy can allow you to maximize you base-building and funnel bugs into devastating killzones made of their fallen foes. Used at its best, Carnage can change the course of a battle, letting you snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. And live to fight another bug.
