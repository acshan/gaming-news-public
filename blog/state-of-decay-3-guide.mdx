State of Decay 3 is set to bring back Undead Lab's open-world survival zombie series with a new experience that will build on what's come before. Officially revealed back in 2020, the [Xbox Game Showcase 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/gaming/events-conferences/xbox-games-showcase-bethesda-live-coverage/) reveals at last gave us a substantial update on the project.

With a new trailer and more details dropping about the larger open-world direction of the sequel to 2018's State of Decay 2, Undead Labs is setting out to make a more ambitious follow-up - with a bigger team forming under the [<u>Xbox Game Studios</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-game-studios-microsoft/) banner.

It had been quite some time since we'd heard or seen much about State of Decay 3, but the latest news suggests it could be one very exciting [upcoming Xbox Series X game](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-xbox-series-x-games/) to look forward to.

For a full recap, read on below to get an overview of everything we know so far about State of Decay 3.

This overview of everything we know so far about State of Decay 3 was updated on November 6, 2024 to include the latest news and details. 



[Xbox Game Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/xbox-game-studios/) is yet to confirm a release date for State of Decay 3. After being announced at the Xbox Games Showcase back in 2020, a trailer later dropped in 2024, but nothing has been confirmed as of yet about when we can expect the third entry to launch.



State of Decay 3 is set to release on Xbox Series X and PC. Like all of the other video games in development under the Xbox Games Studio publishing wing, State of Decay 3 will launch day one on the [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.gamesradar.com/what-is-xbox-game-pass/) subscription service, and is expected to be available via [Xbox Cloud Gaming](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-cloud-gaming/) like its predecessor, [State of Decay 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/state-of-decay-2-review/).

State of Decay 3 made its debut during the Xbox Games Showcase at E3 2020. It was revealed with a 90 second cinematic trailer, showing a lone character equipped with a knife and crossbow trying to survive in a snowy wasteland. You can watch the first State of Decay 3 trailer above.

Four years later, [we then at long last got another look](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/4-years-after-its-reveal-state-of-decay-3-is-back-with-a-first-look-at-its-gorgeous-and-emotional-open-world-zombie-action/) at the upcoming survival zombie game with a [new trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjL3a5ZOFNo&rco=1) during the Xbox Game Showcase 2024. Appearing to show small snippets of gameplay, the trailer showed off State of Decay's emphasis on the survivors and the permadeath feature from previous games, with the characters remembering those they've lost along the way.



We've still not really seen all that much in the way of State of Decay 3 gameplay, but the studio is aiming to deliver the[ "new ultimate in zombie survival simulation."](https://www.gamesradar.com/state-of-decay-3-studio-founder-says-he-wanted-it-to-be-the-ultimate-fulfillment-of-the-survival-fantasy/) As for what the "next evolution in State of Decay" will ultimately look like, [a podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F4pAZ1V0bA) from Xbox's Major Nelson back in 2022 revealed that the game is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, [<u>with Undead Labs collaborating with Gears of War developer The Coalition to get the most out of the platform</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/state-of-decay-3-is-being-developed-in-unreal-engine-5-with-the-help-of-gears-of-war-studio/).

State of Decay 2 was a survival simulation which let you navigate a zombie apocalypse by shaping your own community of survivors, managing resources, and establishing defenses against a surmounting horde of undead intruders.

An [Xbox Wire post](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/state-of-decay-3-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/) following the Xbox Game Showcase 2024 detailed that State of Decay 3 is set to build on those foundations in a "much larger, truly shared open world". Features from previous installments will be making a comeback, with a greater emphasis put on permadeath to really drive the idea that a community member has been lost.

"I think it's important for not just the player to have that remembrance, but the characters in the world as well," creative director Kevin Patzelt explains. "So, our narrative systems are really going to be there to help support those biggest ones. Because there’s nothing bigger than losing a community member, especially if there's someone that you invested a lot of time and energy into. I think we need to do a better job of showing that sacrifice is meaningful and how it might impact the community."



The June 2024 Xbox Wire post detailed that Undead Labs is collaborating with [Obsidian Entertainment](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/obsidian-entertainment/) - the studio behind co-op game [Grounded](https://www.gamesradar.com/grounded/) - to bring to life the "shared world feature" and enable more "flexible online co-op".

“We're heavily emphasizing engaging co-op combat," Patzelt details in Xbox Wire. "Taking a close look at our level design and approach to how we're building the world to ensure that players can have a blast smashing and shooting zombies together out in the open world".



State of Decay 3 may have been announced in 2020, but it has been reported that the game was still in pre-production as of 2022. [<u>This news came out as part of an investigation into developer Undead Labs' workplace culture</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/staff-allege-toxic-culture-and-mismanagement-at-state-of-decay-3-studio/), in which studio staff put forward [<u>allegations of sexism, bullying, and burnout to reporters at Kotaku</u>](https://kotaku.com/state-of-decay-3-xbox-series-x-s-sexism-microsoft-undea-1848728682).

Following these reports, it had been quiet on the State of Decay 3 front for quite some time before a fresh trailer dropped for the game during the Xbox Games Showcase in summer 2024. Most recently, the studio has revealed a logo change, with a dev diary shedding light on an increased headcount on the team, which is [now six times larger than it was for the first State of Decay](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/state-of-decay-3-studio-say-its-bigger-than-ever-with-6-times-the-amount-of-developers-it-had-on-its-first-zombie-survival-game/).
