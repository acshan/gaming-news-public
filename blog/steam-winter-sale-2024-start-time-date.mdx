The Steam Winter Sale is here, and I'm done feeling guilty for spending all of my holiday shopping money on games. You should do the same, provided you have a loving and forgiving group of people around you.

I'll be frank with you, dear readers, and advise you to shield your wallet's ears, as what I'm about to say could be devastating to your bank account: this year's Steam Winter Sale is an absolute banger. It includes steep discounts on some of the best games of the year, including Silent Hill 2 Remake, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and the underrated Resident Evil-like indie horror Crow Country; all-time RPG greats like The Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate 3, and Skyrim; and indie gems like Balatro, Vampire Survivors, and Among Us.

Not to flex, but I've been writing about video game deals professionally for five years now, so I consider myself something of an expert on the matter, and here's what I consider the best deals of the Steam Winter Sale 2024:

Of course, it's always worth having a look at the sale directly yourself as there are literally hundreds, if not thousands of games, on sale. The above are merely the highlights from my limited perspective in terms of relevance.

As for when the Steam Winter Sale 2024 ends, you've got exactly two weeks as the deal door slams shut on January 2 at 10am PST / 1pm EST / 6pm GMT / 7pm CET.
