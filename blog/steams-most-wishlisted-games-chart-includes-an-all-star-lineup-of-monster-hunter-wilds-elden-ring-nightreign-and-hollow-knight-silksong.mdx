Going into the new year, [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) overtakes hero shooter hybrid Deadlock and long-awaited subterranean sequel [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://www.gamesradar.com/hollow-knight-silksong-guide/) as Steam's most-wishlisted game.

[Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/)'s big beast blockbuster is stomping to release later next month on February 28, shortly after a second [Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-a-second-beta-test-with-a-returning-monster-from-the-series-but-improvements-from-the-first-round-wont-be-ready-in-time/). It's fast approaching, the first beta already pulled in monstrous numbers, and Monster Hunter Worlds has been a consistently massive deal, so it's no surprise to see the sequel top [Steam's most-wishlisted games](https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/) chart.

When Monster Hunter Wilds is finally out in the wild (sorry!) next month, [Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s Deadlock – the MOBA-shooter hybrid it didn't announce until it was already a big hit – will reclaim its top spot. Valve say it's still in "early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay," meaning it might stay on this list for a while longer.

Hopefully it won't linger there for as quite long as Hollow Knight: Silksong, the side-scrolling Metroidvania that's taken and lost first place honors a couple times since its announcement in 2019. Developer Team Cherry has been so tight-lipped about the project, Silksong's garnered somewhat of a mythical reputation. The developer insists it's still ["real, progressing and will release,"](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-hollow-knight-silksong-arg-turned-out-to-be-us-clutching-at-straws-but-dev-says-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release/) however.

Sid Meier's Civilization 7, co-op spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign, ultra-realistic life sim rival Inzoi, No Man's Sky developer's fantasy open world Light No Fire, Vin Diesel's Ark 2, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and underwater survival sequel Subnautica 2 all round out the top ten in that order.
