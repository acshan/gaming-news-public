Stellar Blade director Kim Hyung-tae was inspired to start making games by PS1 classics like Ridge Racer and Final Fantasy after being "too poor" to afford a gaming console as a child.

In PlayStation's latest entry in the 'Stellar Blade - The Journey' video series ([timestamped here](https://youtu.be/lURBM0Mgtes?si=tRSoQgZ5WmwZKFUv&t=509)), Hyung-tae talks about his gaming origins, which apparently began with a PS1 in college and ultimately led to him directing one of PS5's biggest releases of 2024.

"I grew up too poor to afford a gaming console, and only when I became a college student could I finally purchase PS1," he said. "I enjoyed playing games like Ridge Racer and Final Fantasy, and this ignited a strong desire in me to create games like this."

To see Stellar Blade then become one of the hottest new releases of the year, particularly in the [PS5 exclusives](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-exclusives/) category, it quite wholesome indeed.Â 

"In Korea, there are not many opportunities to create console games, so there is a strong desire to make good games for global users. When Stellar Blade is released, I help it becomes an example that South Korean developers can developer a console game."

We still don't know how reviews for Stellar Blade will shake out, but the demo has been pretty popular. [Austin's time with the demo left him with a "tentatively good feeling" about the game](https://www.gamesradar.com/stellar-blade-hands-on-preview/), while [some other folks spent so much time playing it that the developers said they felt a bit "scared" by the response](https://www.gamesradar.com/stellar-blade-dev-a-bit-scared-by-diehard-fans-whove-somehow-already-put-50-hours-into-the-ps5-action-rpg-please-go-easy-on-the-demo/) - [and rightfully so](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/oh-thats-why-the-stellar-blade-devs-were-terrified-by-demo-players-one-fans-spent-about-60-hours-maxing-eves-skill-tree-before-the-action-rpg-is-even-out/).

*Only time will tell if Stellar Blade joins the ranks of the *[<em>best PS5 games</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-ps5-games/)* of all time.*
