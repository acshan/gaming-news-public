Strategy RPG Unicorn Overlord officially crossed 1 million copies sold this month, as publisher Atlus announced on September 23, just under seven months after its March 8 launch. Compared to developer Vanillaware's previous game, 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, it's reached the 1 million mark nearly seven times faster.

13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim, a story-focused sci-fi epic mostly split between side-scrolling exploration and top-down mecha combat, launched on PS4 in Japan in November 2019 and globally in September 2020. It later came to Switch worldwide in April 2022. [<u>As Crunchyroll reports</u>](https://crunchyroll.pxf.io/c/221109/1355381/16324?subId1=grd-us-8993663596106092167&sharedId=grd-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fnews%2Flatest%2F2023%2F8%2F31%2F13-sentinels-aegis-rim-one-million-sales%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoos7BuWvLwijAz-36vH4he8AQc_68PR8nkQUqhshvr4MX8RDJVF), it wasn't until August 2023 that it passed 1 million copies sold – approximately 45 months later. 

Unicorn Overlord had a few big advantages, then. It didn't have a staggered global launch, and it's been on PS4, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S – multiple modern platforms – from day one. (Now where the heck is the PC port?) And while these games may be niche enough that [<u>even the director of Final Fantasy Tactics advised fans to support Unicorn Overlord</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-tactics-director-encourages-fans-begging-for-a-remake-to-give-unicorn-overlord-their-support-the-market-for-tactical-rpgs-is-small/) because "the market for tactical RPGs is small," the genre is probably better established than the mish-mash of 13 Sentinels, especially when Vanillaware is generally known for gameplay- and combat-focused games rather than sprawling narratives. 

Both games are excellent, to be clear, but there's no question which one left a bigger mark on me. [<u>I poured 240 hours into Unicorn Overlord and it's still my 2024 Game of the Year pick</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/strategy-rpg-unicorn-overlord-supposedly-takes-60-hours-to-beat-it-took-me-240-and-is-now-one-of-my-favorite-games-of-all-time/) by a country mile. Hell, it's now my third-favorite game *of all time*. It's so clearly burned into my memory that, months later, I can still remember the gear and attack programming setups I had for the three women in the celebratory art above. Rosalinde, my goat. Visually stunning, tactically satisfying, mechanically engrossing, and narratively* competent*, Unicorn Overlord feels like a game made just for me, but clearly at least a million other people were interested too.
