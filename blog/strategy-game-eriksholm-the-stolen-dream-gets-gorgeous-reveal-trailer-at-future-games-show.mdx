Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream was revealed at the Future Games Show with a spectacular trailer that shows a mix of on-the-run tension, clashing loyalties, and stealth-strategy gameplay. Brought to us by Nordcurrent Labs, the game features three playable protagonists - Alva, Hanna and Sebastian - each with their own abilities and talents to help them get through the perils ahead.

The final result looks like a fascinating hybrid of Dishonored and Weird West, filtered through a uniquely Swedish take, as developer River End Games cites the titular city of Eriksholm as being inspired by Swedish locales like Gothenburg, Stockholm, and Malmö, as they were in the early 1900s.

Meanwhile, our heroes are struggling at ground level just to survive - and then things get worse. When young orphan Herman steals something far more valuable than he realises and disappears, it's up to Hanna and her allies to find the greater truth about what's going on. With each of the three characters having unique powers and abilities, the top-down levels are built to be explored over and over, with secrets to find and different paths and methods for each character - though no matter which of the three you're playing as, you definitely don't want to get caught by the authorities.

Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream is scheduled for release in early 2025, and will be playable on both PC and console alike.
