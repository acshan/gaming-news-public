Run Out is a cute and colorful party game that mashes together Super Mario and Fall Guys influences and it's coming to PC this year.

Revealed at [The Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Summer Showcase with an endearingly chaotic trailer that's giving Fall Guys energy, this one uses procedural generation to ensure that no two races are the same.

While the course layout varies, from 3D to 2.5D views, there are some common rules that add a touch of order to the chaos. The ultimate goal is to be the first to reach the stuffed bear at the end. But beware of the random switches that can either aid your progress or create more obstacles for everyone to overcome. The old-school level design and camera perspective bring Mario games to mind, which serves as an influence on the game.

Then there are those cute characters you see darting across the screen. You've got a slew of outfit choices to ensure your chosen character matches your sense of style. Watch out, though, as each character can use unique skills to knock you off focus or clear their way to that coveted teddy bear. Controls are kept simple too, ensuring what you get is easy to pick up but has plenty to master. 

If you like what you see, you can [wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2438120/RunOut__Run__Fun_Together/) and follow its progress.
