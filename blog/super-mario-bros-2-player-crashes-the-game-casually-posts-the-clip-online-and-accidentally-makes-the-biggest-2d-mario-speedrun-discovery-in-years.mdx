A massive new discovery in the 2D Mario speedrunning world has been made, and it's all thanks to an entirely accidental gameplay clip that a casual player happened to post online.

On March 13, a user going by Luigi's Sidekick posted a [few clips on Twitter](https://x.com/LuigiSidekick/status/1900072261555458205) while playing through the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 – best known to most of us English-speakers as The Lost Levels – via the Nintendo Switch Online NES library. In one of those clips, the game simply crashes in the final level, 8-4, prompting a message from the Switch interface that "an error has occurred within the game," followed by an unceremonious boot back to the game select screen.

That was that for several weeks – until, suddenly, the video got noticed by Mario speedrunners, who recognized that it was possible for this crash to lead to lead to a method for arbitrary code execution, or ACE. This crash essentially sets SMB2 looking for code in places that it shouldn't, and by manipulating parts of a memory in certain ways – for example, by making sure enemies are in precise positions or that you have a certain number of codes – you can more or less feed the game a cheat code that warps you to the ending.

Mario speedrunner Kosmic – the same Kosmic who recently [discovered that Donkey Kong's legendary kill screen isn't really the end](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/after-44-years-donkey-kong-player-discovers-that-the-legendary-kill-screen-isnt-really-the-end/) – joked it might take a "couple... months" to break down exactly what's happening here. But if you want a ["very short" version of the answer](https://x.com/Kosmicd12/status/1906047991653568673): "If you set up all of the object slots a certain way, the long firebar can be loaded in out of bounds memory," Kosmic explains. "Doing it twice can write even further out of bounds and start a chain reaction which would usually crash the game, but with extreme precision can win."

Within days of Mario speedrunners finding the crash, they'd replicated it and built out a method to use ACE to warp to the end of SMB2. [Kosmic posted a clip](https://x.com/Kosmicd12/status/1906046733383295043) of the warp created by fellow runner threecreepio on Twitter, calling it "The Biggest 2D Mario speedrun discovery in years." This one was tool-assisted, as it's likely far too difficult for a human to do in real time, but the community seems confident that a viable path to executing this trick for real will be found.

The catch here is that this ACE exploit only works in 8-4 which is, again, the game's final level. The trick is ultimately only likely to save 10 to 15 seconds, but that's still pretty substantial for a well-documented game like this. The old world record – which was set by Niftski all the way back in 2022 – might still be safe, however, as it's likely the game's any% category will be split into ACE and non-ACE versions if a human-viable method of doing the trick is worked out.

"I genuinely can’t believe a random crash I had with this game actually helped discover a new speed run trick," Luigi's Sidekick [said on Twitter](https://x.com/LuigiSidekick/status/1906051494211879186) after the ACE exploit was posted. "How the hell did I do that?"

One more fun detail: the crash occurs just as Mario falls into a lava pit while colliding with a castle wall. That's the exact image that appears on the North American cover art for the original Super Mario Bros., and as some [viral tweets](https://x.com/naim_haziq32999/status/1906192120509301193) have noted, Nintendo accidentally created some pretty incredible foreshadowing here.
