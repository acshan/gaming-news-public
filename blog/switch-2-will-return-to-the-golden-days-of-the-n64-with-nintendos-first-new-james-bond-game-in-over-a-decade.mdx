Nintendo revealed at today's [Switch 2 Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/) that the console will receive an official James Bond game, a first for the developer since 007 Legends released for Wii U in 2012.[Project 007](https://www.gamesradar.com/project-007-james-bond-game-io-interactive-guide/), which Hitman developer IO Interactive initially announced in 2020, is still maintaining its undercover status, however, as IO remained reticent to share much about the game during the Switch 2 Direct. Actually, it didn't share any details at all. We just know it's coming to [Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) now, which is cool!All Christian Elverdam, IO's chief creative officer, could offer was this: "James Bond – the world's favorite spy – is coming to Nintendo Switch 2, so stay tuned." You heard the man.

Of course, any card-carrying member of the Nintendo gaming community of a certain age will fondly remember lighting up their friends in 1997's GoldenEye 007, the Rare-developed splitscreen multiplayer first-person shooter based on the 1995 James Bond movie, GoldenEye. Frankly, if this fancy new Project 007 doesn't include some sort of splitscreen multiplayer mode in tribute to the glory days of multiplayer FPS, what's even the point?

Coming back down to earth, we have zero indication that Project 007 will have a multiplayer mode, much less splitscreen, with the focus being the stealth gameplay that IO has become known for through the Hitman series. And all joking aside, that sounds delightful.
