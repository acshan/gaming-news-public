After working yourself to the bone for the ruthless Mega Corp, one day out of nowhere you receive an email saying you've been laid off and the shock literally kills you. Thankfully, as seen during the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) at Gamescom Presented by Sid Meier’s Civilization® VII, this isn't the end of your story and you can use your new spirit powers to take down the company from within.

Initially, this involves launching objects across the office, then sitting back and watching the physics-based chaos unfold. To spice things up, if any of your ex-colleagues get hit by flying items then they'll immediately rage and attack the nearest co-worker, before quitting or getting knocked out into early retirement. These fights play out as hilarious ragdoll brawls, with all sorts of punches, kicks, and special moves thrown into the mix as they crash through nearby furniture.

As you progress you'll discover various methods for obtaining score multipliers, such as landing headshots with your thrown items, redirecting objects with the gusts from fans, and triggering haunted furniture into action. This is where the puzzle element comes in, as you'll need to combine these to create chain reactions if you want to score highly enough to move on or claim a top rating.

There are also sections where you can possess your ghostly companion and move around manually to smash items up, while also flinging yourself about to generate superpowered hits that deal with the toughest enemies and obstacles. This is the method used for the boss fights at the end of each area, and by taking down the department heads you can unlock new powers while investigating their offices to uncover the secret of what's really going on at Mega Corp.

Office Fight is out now on PC, so you can [play it on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747060/Office_Fight/) right away, and there's a demo available if you want to try it first. Later console releases are planned for Xbox and Nintendo Switch, so follow [@OfficeFightGame](https://x.com/OfficeFightGame) for the latest news.
