Big robots fighting is literally the name of the game in Mecha Break's multiplayer mech combat, with a new [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) trailer showing off its ‘Global Storm’ open beta.

The open beta is now closed, but it hit a peak player count of over 317,000 players and 3.5 million players overall so you're going to be among (a lot of) friends when the game releases.

Mecha BREAK's Global Storm open beta introduced an all new tactical co-op PvPvE extraction mode called Mashmak, alongside the 6v6 and 3v3 modes from previous betas. It marked the first time anyone's been able to play Mashmak, a new challenge that sees pilots fighting to control the Mashmak Isles. This location holds vast reserves of Eruptive Inorganic Carbide, or Corite, a mysterious new mineral that's revitalised Earth's depleted energy, but is a curse as much as a blessing due to its toxic spread.

To control the Corite in Mashmak you'll be piloting your third generation BREAK striker mech across a 200-square-kilometer combat area. Flying solo or in a team of three, you'll need to deal with hostile Theia's Vanguard forces, other teams and Corite pulse storms ravaging the landscape. If you can survive all that, you'll then need to find valuable upgrade materials you can use to improve your gear for other runs.

While the brave can try and go it alone, Mecha BREAK's multiplayer is built for an array of classes that encourage teamwork. Gather your friends and build a team to survive from assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance and support options. There are thirteen different mechs to choose from, so there's plenty to experiment with.

As well the PvPvE Mashmak mode, and 6v6 or 3v3 modes, the Global Storm open beta also included the opening tutorial, character and mech customization, a training room, and explorable space station, so there's plenty to come with the full release. The full game will be releasing in 2025 on PC and Xbox, with more platforms to come later.
