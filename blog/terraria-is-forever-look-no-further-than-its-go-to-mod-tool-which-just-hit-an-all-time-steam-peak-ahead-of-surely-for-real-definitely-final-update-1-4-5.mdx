Re-Logic's action sandbox game Terraria is the game that keeps on giving. With its sixth "final" update on the way (which, at this point, we know almost certainly won't be the *actual *final update), the devs have been keeping us fed for almost 14 years, but perhaps it's little wonder when the community is still thriving well over a decade on.

As [<u>highlighted by Terraria YouTuber ChippyGaming</u>](https://bsky.app/profile/chippygamingyt.bsky.social/post/3ljdylu4s622p), last week, the community-driven mod that lets you play and launch Terraria mods, tModLoader, hit a new all-time concurrent player peak on Steam, proving that the hunger for the game and its mods is still growing. To be exact, according to [<u>SteamDB data</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/1281930/charts/#1w), tModLoader hit 50,342 concurrent players on March 1 at 2pm UTC, which, as it happens, was exactly one day before [<u>Steam broke its own concurrent user record again</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/steam-has-doubled-in-size-in-just-5-years-as-monster-hunter-wilds-launch-pushes-it-beyond-40-million-concurrent-users/), passing 40 million for the first time.

Terraria itself hasn't broken its concurrent player peak on Steam in quite some time – it saw an enormous surge in May 2020, [<u>hitting 489,886 simultaneous players</u>](https://steamdb.info/app/105600/charts/#6y) around the release of the once-final 1.4 Journey's End update. We'll just have to see if it can surpass that whenever the next update, 1.4.5, eventually launches – it was originally planned for 2023, but last year, the devs said that there was [<u>"no way" it was releasing before 2025</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/terraria-developer-says-there-is-no-way-its-sixth-final-update-comes-out-before-2025-because-its-committed-to-being-a-quality-first-studio/).

A couple of months ago, [<u>Re-Logic stated that it was "hopeful that this year will bring the long-awaited update,"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/as-terrarias-sixth-final-update-approaches-the-devs-are-still-planning-an-ideation-session-to-make-sure-they-dont-forget-to-add-anything/) so we'll just have to watch this space. Either way, lead developer Andrew "Redigit" Spinks has [<u>made it clear that "Terraria will never die as long as there is one last final update,"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/terraria-will-never-die-as-long-as-there-is-one-last-final-update-creator-says-as-its-6th-final-update-approaches-at-long-last/) so hopefully we still have many more years of the game ahead of us, and numerous "final" updates to come.
