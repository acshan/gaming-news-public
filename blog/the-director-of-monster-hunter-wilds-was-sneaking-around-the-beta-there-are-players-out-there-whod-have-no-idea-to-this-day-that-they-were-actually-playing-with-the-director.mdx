You better be on your best behavior when playing the [second Monster Hunter Wilds beta](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-second-how-to-access/) this weekend, as you may just find yourself in the company of the game's director.

Speaking to GamesRadar+ about how much the devs watch or play the beta, [Monster Hunter Wilds](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/) director Yuya Tokuda says, "A lot," actually. Tokuda shares that the Wilds team spends a lot of time reviewing people's beta streams and videos to "see feedback that we can't really get internally" – something the [chief designer of the Lance found useful](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/i-went-all-the-way-to-japan-to-ask-the-monster-hunter-wilds-devs-what-the-heck-theyve-done-to-my-favorite-weapon-and-what-do-you-know-they-were-prepared/) especially.

Mind you, not all feedback gathering is done from afar. Tokuda says the devs play the beta for a closer look at how everyone gets on with the game.

"So on my own personal console, I took part in the beta," he shares. "You can't tell it's me from the username, but there are players out there who'd have no idea to this day that they were actually playing with the director of the game.

"I would go online and put an SOS flare up, and that would mean that a couple of players would join my party, and that gives me a chance to see – whenever staff play the game at the company together, there's a certain amount of 'we all know the game inside out' – getting a chance to see real players on how they react to the content is really important to me, to understand if it's working or not. That was a great opportunity for me as well."

It's not just Tokuda, either. Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto says he'll return to the beta "straight away" after finishing some travel to promote the game. You'd better keep those monster-hunting skills sharp, pals, as [Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) is watching.

*In good news for Tokuda and us, then, *[<em>Capcom is extending the next Monster Hunter Wilds open beta for an extra day as the "test period was cut short." </em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/as-psn-outages-subside-capcom-might-extend-monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-for-an-extra-day-as-the-test-period-was-cut-short/)**
