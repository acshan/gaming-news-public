While there's no official animated adaptation of the RPG from [<u>FromSoftware</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) yet, an [<u>Elden Ring</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring/) anime made entirely by fans is arriving this summer â€“ and even Let Me Solo Her is looking forward to it, apparently.

The [<u>fan-made Elden Ring anime</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/this-fan-made-elden-ring-anime-teaser-shows-a-greatest-hits-collection-of-the-rpgs-bosses-and-its-out-later-this-year/) was originally meant to drop late last year but was delayed to summer 2025 â€“ a season that's just months away now. The production's director, who goes by "SteinsAlter" online, has been posting teasers since the project's initial reveal in 2024 â€“ and his latest has managed to capture the attention of Let Me Solo Her, a legendary Souls player who [<u>rose to fame by defeating tough bosses on his own</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/one-elden-ring-player-is-soloing-malenia-for-dozens-of-others/) to help others.

ELDEN RING ANIME New Teaser! Happy 3rd ANNIVERSARY for Elden RING! We will be releasing more news and updates soon so follow and more on the patreon discord server! pic.twitter.com/HHKEaNd0uz[February 25, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1894470449997709396)

Sharing SteinsAlter's most recent clip of the upcoming anime, Let Me Solo Her admits that he's seen some of the project "behind the scenes" himself and it's impressed him â€“ to say the least. "I've had the pleasure of watching this team behind the scenes and they're honestly cooking up something amazing," writes the beloved player. "I hope you guys are excited as I am." Judging by fans' comments, I'd say it's safe to say they are indeed.

"This looks sick," reads one reply. "This is about to be amazing," writes another fan â€“ and I'm inclined to agree. From Bayle to Blaidd, the fan-made animation seems to nail the design of Elden Ring's iconic cast and then some. I'm only sad that it's set to be just five minutes long once it releases, but who knows â€“ the community might be blessed with a follow-up should SteinsAlter and his team's first launch prove as successful as it appears it will.
