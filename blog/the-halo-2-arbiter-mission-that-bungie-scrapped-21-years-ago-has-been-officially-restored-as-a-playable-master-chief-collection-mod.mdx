A Halo 2 level that was scrapped well before its 2004 release has now been officially excavated, dusted off, and made playable within The Master Chief Collection. 

[Halo Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/halo/newly-rebranded-halo-studios-kicks-off-the-iconic-fps-series-next-era-with-multiple-games-in-development-chapter-1-bungie-chapter-2-343-industries/) and modders The Digsite Team have been restoring lost Halo content for years now, starting off with never-before-seen maps and weapons and vehicles that original series developer [Bungie](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/bungie/) left on the cutting room floor. It's fitting for a series all about exploring ancient, long abandoned alien structures, but Digsite have recently gotten even more ambitious with its goal.

[For Halo 2's massive 20th anniversary, the team went back to the game's infamous E3 2003 demo](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/halo/for-its-20th-anniversary-halo-2s-infamous-e3-2003-demo-that-never-made-it-into-the-final-game-is-coming-to-halo-mcc/) that never made it into the full game, spruced it up with existing assets and all-new ones, and then released it as a mod for Halo: The Master Chief Collection's PC version. They've now done the same with a long-lost Arbiter mission that sent humanity's alien bestie to a desolate moon impaled with the shards of the titular Halo from the first game.

"This scenario is a composite reconstruction of the 2003 mission '05_alphamoon' assembled from archived data, design documents, and our own restorative work to showcase early Halo 2 development," the mission's start-up screen reads. "While care has been taken to present this level in a further completed state, Alpha Moon originally never developed beyond the 'Halo 1.5' phase." As such, you might bump into some unintended bugs or difficulty hikes.

That's a small price to pay for another classic Halo campaign level, though. Alpha Moon follows a formula that the series has used over and over for a reason. It starts out lowkey with the Arbiter touching down on his lonesome, equipped with nothing other than a rifle and an invisibility power-up for some stealthy back melees. But it doesn't take long for those explosions (and explosive guitar riffs) to come in as the level soon puts you into a Covenant tank where, in classic Halo fashion, you're blasting an outdoor corridor full of little grunt gangs and cranky enemy vehicles.
