Nintendo has confirmed that enhanced [<u>Switch 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are on the way.

One of the most exciting pieces of [<u>Nintendo Switch 2 Direct news</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-live-april-2-announcements/) was Nintendo's official [reveal of Nintendo Switch 2 <em>Edition </em>games](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-for-nintendo-switch-games-are-coming-with-metroid-prime-4-and-pokemon-legends-z-a-confirmed-for-the-new-console/). It's explained that "some games that were released on Switch will receive upgraded versions that offer things like improved visuals, unique ways to play on Switch 2, and more." Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are two of these [<u>upcoming Switch 2 games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-switch-2-games/).

In the case of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the two open-world Zelda games will be given enhanced resolution and frame rate, as well as HDR compatibility to render "more vibrant colors." In addition, a new Nintendo Switch App feature called Zelda Notes will work exclusively with the Switch 2 Edition versions of the games. This app will offer features like guiding you to new shrines (a bit like a Zelda Sat Nav), and let other players autobuild your Tears of the Kingdom creations via QR codes. Finally, we're back to the Fallout 4 pip boy app era.

Nintendo has confirmed that Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades will cost money. However, in Zelda's case [Nintendo has confirmed](https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/whats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2/) that both game's upgrades will be available free of charge to anyone subscribed to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack. Plus Nintendo Switch 2 Edition versions of both games will be made available as physical releases. However, from a look at the Nintendo Switch 2 boxart for the games ([spotted by Wario64 on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lltnlsnk662v)), it seems like these will just be the original Nintendo Switch game cartridges with a digital version of the upgrade as opposed to the new version on a new cartridge.
