Following [<u>Capcom</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/)'s release of its long-awaited [<u>first free update</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-update-coming-early-april-will-crank-up-the-difficulty-and-add-a-new-place-to-hang-out-with-other-players-addressing-2-big-concerns/) for [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-guide/), a new limited-time event quest has arrived â€“ and it marks the unexpected return of the so-called "baby Pukei-Pukei," an adorable little bird players can now wear as head armor.

The cute creature first went viral back in 2024 when fans learned what they called the baby Pukei-Pukei [<u>was actually just a regular old bird</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-fans-in-shambles-to-learn-the-beloved-baby-pukei-pukei-they-would-die-for-is-actually-just-a-regular-old-bird-my-wife-just-said-she-is-no-longer-interested/), much to the community's dismay. That very same bird is back in the limelight now, however, and it's returning as so much more thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' latest limited-time event quest: "When Do Quematrice Sing?" From now until April 22 (or April 23, if going by BST), the small beast is obtainable as head armor.

[Capcom](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/capcom/) reveals the quest and its precious award in a recent online [<u>post</u>](https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1909761987690512637), jokingly calling it the "baby Pukei-Pukei" before correcting itself and unveiling the "Amstrigian Î± head armor." Attached to the studio's announcement is a screenshot of the armor as it appears in-game on characters' heads â€“ a chunky owl-like bird perched upon a hunter, its mouth open to form what might just be the cutest smile ever debuted in any video game.

Unsurprisingly, fans are already obsessed (it's me, I'm fans). "Say less," reads one comment on Capcom's post. "GIMMIE," exclaims another player. The excitement doesn't end with the baby Pukei-Pukei, either â€“ the first major milestone on [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds' roadmap</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap/) was also recently reached with the arrival of the hotly anticipated [<u>Title Update 1</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-is-out-april-4-and-looks-stacked-zoh-shia-returns-the-grand-hub-adds-a-social-space-plus-arch-tempered-rey-dau-arena-speedrun-contests-and-mizutsune/). There's plenty more yet to come, too, including [<u>"balance changes"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-director-reveals-upcoming-balance-changes-for-the-action-rpg-including-weapon-improvements-and-nerfs-for-the-unintentionally-overpowered/) and the game's first seasonal event.

Our own [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds review</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-review/) praises the action RPG for its combat, narrative, and "diverse roster of new and old monsters" â€“ and it seems as though it's set to only get better as time goes on.*After you finish playing one of the *[<u><em>best Monster Hunter games</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-monster-hunter-games/)* to date, here are some of the other most exciting *[<u><em>new games</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/)* this year and beyond to keep an eye on.*
