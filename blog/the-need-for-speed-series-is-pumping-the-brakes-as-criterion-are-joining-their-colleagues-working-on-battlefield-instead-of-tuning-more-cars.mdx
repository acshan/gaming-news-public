There are currently no developers at Criterion working on my favorite racing game series, [<u>Need For Speed</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-need-for-speed-games/). Instead, the studio is one of four under EA lending support to [<u>Battlefield</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-battlefield-games/).

In a statement given to [<u>Eurogamer</u>](https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now), EA's Battlefield boss Vince Zampella says: "The Need for Speed team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield. As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for [<u>Unbound</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/need-for-speed-unbound-review/)."

Although I loved the Need For Speed series as a kid, I fell off for a while until Heat and Unbound came out and returned the car-tuning games to their former glory. Unbound has been the perfect mix of new and old, showing a great appreciation for the game's hip-hop aesthetics and offering a tense and challenging story mode. It's been supported by Criterion since release, with new updates being added consistently.

"With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways," says Zampella. I'd be happy with more of the same, or a direct sequel to Heat that had a more focused and fleshed out story.Â 

But for now, Criterion is joining DICE, Ripple Effect, and Motive to work on the next Battlefield game. I like Battlefield as much as the next person (I spent an absurd number of hours on the 24/7 Metro server on Battlefield 3), but it's sad to see so many great studios all working on one cash cow instead of making cool new games.

*While we wait for more Battlefield and cry over the lack of Need For Speed, check out all the upcoming *[<u><em>video game release dates</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/)* so you know what to look forward to this year.*
