Palworld developer Pocketpair may be in the middle of a [<u>legal battle against Nintendo and The Pokemon Company</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/its-official-palworld-has-been-nintendod-as-the-pokemon-company-files-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-for-infringing-multiple-patent-rights/), but that's not stopped its hit survival game from having a phenomenal first month on PS5. 

[<u>Palworld</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/palworld-guide/) made its debut on PS5 in a [<u>surprise launch on September 26 in 68 countries</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/palworld-powers-through-nintendos-lawsuit-to-launch-on-ps5-today/), although a short delay meant that it [<u>came to Japan slightly later on October 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/palworld-escapes-indefinite-delay-launches-on-ps5-in-japan-today-despite-the-survival-games-ongoing-legal-battle-with-nintendo/). Clearly, a lot of PlayStation owners were eager to give the survival game a go because it's number one in October's PS5 download rankings in Japan and number 10 in the US and Canada, according to [PlayStation's official roundup](https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/11/11/20241111-downloadranking/). 

It had some fierce competition for those places, too. In Japan, it managed to beat both Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero and [<u>Metaphor: ReFantazio</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/metaphor-refantazio-guide/) – two enormous October releases, as well as the likes of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the [<u>Silent Hill 2</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/silent-hill-2-remake-guide/) remake, and more. The ranking in the US and Canada is quite different, with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on top and Undisputed in third, although Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero is notably still in second place. Palworld also managed to beat Metaphor: ReFantazio a second time to squeeze its way into the top 10. 

"Palworld didn't do too bad on PS5 in October it seems!" Palworld community manager and game designer [<u>Bucky writes on Twitter</u>](https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1855809368387944841), sharing the charts. "Thank you PlayStation gamers!"

Nintendo and [The Pokemon Company](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/the-pokemon-company/) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Pocketpair in September, and it's now been revealed [<u>which exact patents the Palworld developer is alleged to have infringed upon</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/palworld-developer-reveals-the-exact-patents-its-alleged-to-have-infringed-upon-in-the-nintendo-lawsuit-and-they-all-have-application-dates-after-the-survival-games-release/). Pocketpair says it will "continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings."
