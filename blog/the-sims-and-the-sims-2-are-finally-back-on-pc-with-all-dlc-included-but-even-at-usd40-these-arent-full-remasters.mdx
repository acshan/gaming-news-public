[Rumors of a Sims and Sims 2 release](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/maxis-teases-something-the-sims-1-and-2-related-and-fans-are-already-frothing-at-the-possibility-of-long-overdue-remasters/https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/maxis-teases-something-the-sims-1-and-2-related-and-fans-are-already-frothing-at-the-possibility-of-long-overdue-remasters/) have been floating about the web all week, and it turns out they're true – EA's iconic 2000 life sim and its beloved sequel are back on PC today.

Hoople borpna to The Sims – it's the series' 25th birthday, and EA is celebrating big with a re-release of the first two games and all of their DLC on PC. Fans can purchase both The Sims and The Sims 2 as part of The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle for $40 or opt to buy just one of the two separately from the collection. The re-releases are available on the EA App, [Epic Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/epic-games/) Store, and Steam – but are not currently on console.

The Sims and The Sims 2 are dropping as Legacy Collections with all expansions and packs included. For the first game, this means Livin' Large, House Party, Hot Date, Vacation, Unleashed, Superstar, Makin’ Magic, and a special kit for [<u>The Sims 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-4-guide/) – the Throwback Fit Kit. Similarly for the sequel, the Legacy Collection boasts all The Sims 2 DLC as well as a Sims 4 goodie thrown in with the Grunge Revival Kit.

It's certainly exciting, but it's important to note that these are re-releases and *not* remasters or remakes by any means. I discuss this more in my own [<u>Sims 2 re-release preview</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/after-11-years-the-sims-2-returns-with-a-re-release-on-the-ea-app-and-steam-and-its-still-as-wonderfully-janky-as-it-was-in-2004/), where I find that while ultimately fun and nostalgic, the Birthday Bundle falls short of some expectations fans might have. It's still very much the same janky 32-bit experience as before, but it's also the only way players without disc copies can (legally) enjoy the series' two most timeless entries.
