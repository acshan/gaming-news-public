[Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/) is getting a new Spider-Man suit inspired by the Advanced Suit 2.0 from [Marvel's Spider-Man 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-spider-man-2-guide/).

The official PlayStation Twitter account revealed the Marvel Rivals version of the Advanced Suit 2.0, and I have to say, it translates beautifully to the online hero shooter's more cartoony art style. I might swing away with a negative K/D ratio because I suck at Spider-Man, but at least I'll look damn good doing it.

Marvel Rivals is adding the Advanced Suit 2.0 to Spider-Man's selection of skins on January 30 - the same day that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 releases on PC after a year-and-change of PS5 exclusivity.

[Marvel Rivals launched last month and hit 10 million players in its first three days](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-celebrates-a-successful-launch-with-netease-games-overwatch-rival-hitting-over-10-million-players-in-just-3-days/), and as it stands [it's more popular than ever](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-is-more-popular-than-ever-soaring-past-570k-steam-players-to-set-a-new-record-as-season-1-launches/). Point being, you can expect more than just new skins in the hero shooter's future, with [its game director having just recently said it'll get new heroes every six weeks](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-will-get-new-heroes-every-6-weeks-game-director-says/).

[Marvel's Spider-Man 2, however, not so much](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/spider-man/spider-man-2-dlc-hopes-dashed-as-insomniac-confirms-we-have-no-additional-story-content-planned-while-touting-the-new-pc-port/). Insomniac confirmed back in October that there's "no additional story content planned" for the acclaimed sequel. Hopefully the PC port bucks the years-long trend of PC ports of PlayStation games being just technically lesser versions of otherwise great games. After all, the PS5 version topped our list of the [best Spider-Man games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-spiderman-games/) of all time, so it deserves a second life on PC.
