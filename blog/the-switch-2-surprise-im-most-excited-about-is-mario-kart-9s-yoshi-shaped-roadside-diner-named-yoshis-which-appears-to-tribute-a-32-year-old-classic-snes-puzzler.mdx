Pretty much the entire internet was expecting today's [Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) debut, but the trailer did bring us a surprise first look at the next Mario Kart game - which, for the sake of convenience, I'm gonna be calling Mario Kart 9 from here on out. More than anything else, I'm obsessed with Yoshi's, which appears to be a Yoshi-owned-and-operated roadside diner that's giving me flashbacks to a 32-year-old puzzle game I thought Nintendo had forgotten about.

The track displayed in the bits of Mario Kart 9 footage we see is set along an American-style highway through the desert, and as befits the setting the racers blast past a roadside diner/gas station combo. Here, though, that diner is shaped like a Yoshi's head and is appropriately named Yoshi's, implying that there's a colorful dinosaur behind the counter slinging burgers.

The Yoshi's logo immediately reminded me of the cover art for the oft-forgotten puzzle game Yoshi's Cookie, originally released in 1993 across NES, SNES, and Game Boy. The tongue-out pose and angle of the face is very similar to the [old game's box art](https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi%27s_Cookie#/media/File:Yoshi'sCookieSNES.jpg), and the little chef's hat immediately calls to mind the [Mario chef outfit](https://www.mariowiki.com/Yoshi%27s_Cookie#/media/File:ChefMario.png) from the old game. Maybe I'm reaching to think this is an official tribute, but at a minimum it looks like Nintendo's bringing Yoshi back to the kitchen after a long, long time away.

The new game doesn't yet have an official title, but given the lineage of the past couple of mainline entries - Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart 8 - calling it anything other than Mario Kart 9 would seem a bit odd. Technically you could count Mario Kart Tour in as the ninth game, making this Mario Kart 10, but that'd be giving the mobile spin-off an honor Nintendo never offered to Mario Kart's numerous arcade entries.

Whatever it ends up being called, the [new Mario Kart appears to show off 24-person multiplayer](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/im-convinced-that-mario-kart-9-has-been-confirmed-as-the-first-nintendo-switch-2-game/) in that trailer, as well as a [whole new look for Donkey Kong seemingly inspired by the Mario movie](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/switch-2-mario-kart-trailer-reveals-a-whole-new-donkey-kong-seemingly-inspired-by-the-mario-movie-dk-aint-look-right/). Perhaps the most shocking detail, though, is that [Princess Peach has given up proper racing gear](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/mario-kart-9-appears-to-take-the-switch-2-back-in-time-swapping-out-princess-peachs-sleek-racing-suit-for-the-outfit-she-wore-when-she-debuted-in-the-kart-racing-series/) to round the track in a full royal gown once again. Good for her, I guess, but that seems like a safety hazard.
