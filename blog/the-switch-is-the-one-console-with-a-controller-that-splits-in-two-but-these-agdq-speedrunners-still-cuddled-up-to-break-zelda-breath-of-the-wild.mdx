AGDQ is underway, and among its usual fare of unbelievable gaming moments, it's also had one that was unusually heartwarming: Breath of the Wild speedrunners Player5 and mikeysgone shared the same controller while completely obliterating Nintendo's open-world game. An any% run has never looked so friendly. 

Of course, Switch controllers have the unique ability to split their Joy-Cons into two remotes, but that was too easy for Player5 and mikeysgone. 

Sharing one solid Switch Pro controller instead adds "unique challenges to the run," Player5 astutely acknowledged [<u>during Games Done Quick</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27wvhVy3rJQ). Though, it's difficult to ascertain any struggle from the way he and mikeysgone immediately and wordlessly manipulate their sides of the controller at the start of the run, accomplishing their first glitch – which skipped cutscenes and deactivated Breath of the Wild's 24-hour cycle as well as its elemental changes – in under 50 seconds. 

For the most part, the rest of the run continues with similar, butter slickness.

"You might have noticed that they didn't even use [...] talking to coordinate," commentator RequiemOfSpirit said at one point, after the speedrunners silently executed a flawless mid-air windbomb, [<u>a tricky glitch</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/14g6te1/what_are_your_opinions_about_windbombing/). "That's because they can tell based on each other's movements and inputs what to do."

The two speedrunners seemed completely in-tune with each other – Player5 buttonmashing, and mikeysgone swiveling the left joystick like it was life-or-death. Finally, after just under 29 minutes, Player5 and mikeysgone delivered a devastating arrow to final boss Ganon's big yellow eyeball, and the any% run was completed, two guys, one controller style. 

"That was crazy," mikeysgone managed to say after a few seconds of stunned silence.
