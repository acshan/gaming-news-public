[Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) Patch 8 is officially set to launch on April 15, and while we already know it's going to be big, the devs at Larian Studios are *really* hyping up just how big it is.

"It's huge," Larian publishing director Michael "Cromwelp" Douse says [while retweeting](https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1910786910450024559) our [previous coverage of Patch 8's impending launch](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3s-long-awaited-patch-8-finally-releases-next-week-as-the-d-and-d-rpg-gets-12-new-subclasses-a-photo-mode-and-more-in-its-final-update/). (Thanks, by the way.) "Details soon. The ultimate Baldur's Gate experience! I can't wait to play through again, and again."

It's unclear exactly when those "details" are going to land, but they'll likely be in the form of patch notes – and what a might set of notes it's going to be, according to Larian CEO and BG3 director Swen Vincke. "I just read the 48 pages of patch notes on this," Vincke says [in a tweet](https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1910725718226448796). "If there were a Michelin guide to patches, I’d give this one 3 stars."

Patch 8 is set to be the final big update for Baldur's Gate 3, and it seems Larian is intent on sending the game off with a bang. The update has been available to players for stress tests over the past few months, so it's not a complete mystery, and we do know that it's [going to add 12 new subclasses, crossplay, and a photo mode](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/larian-wasnt-kidding-when-it-said-its-not-quite-done-baldurs-gate-3-update-will-add-12-new-subclasses-crossplay-photo-mode-and-more-next-year/). Whatever other mysteries this update is hiding, I guess we'll have to wait until April 15 to uncover them for ourselves.
