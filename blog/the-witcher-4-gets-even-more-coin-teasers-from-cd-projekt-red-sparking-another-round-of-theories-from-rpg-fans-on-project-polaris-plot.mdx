Following director Sebastian Kalemba's announcement that [<u>The Witcher 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-release-date/) has now [<u>"entered the full-scale production phase"</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-full-scale-production-phase-cd-projekt-red-confirms-stay-tuned-for-whats-on-the-other-side-of-the-coin/) and an accompanying [<u>teaser</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/as-the-witcher-4-enters-its-full-scale-production-phase-fans-of-the-rpg-series-think-a-new-teaser-holds-answers-about-project-polaris-plot/), developers have shared even more cryptic pictures featuring coins - and fans are once again trying to decipher them.

As [<u>CD Projekt Red</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/) continues its work on The Witcher 4, officially dubbed Project Polaris, devs continue teasing the community with images of coins. Just a couple of weeks back, fans were active in online threads attempting to figure out Kalemba's post accompanied by one such image of coins - and now, there are more. The next [one](https://x.com/vithren/status/1865030198871101558) to drop came from the game's acting lead cinematic designer, and it highlights the same coin Kalemba's did.

As 2024 winds down, I couldn't be prouder of my Cinematic Design team @CDPROJEKTRED. Their creativity and dedication have been incredible. We're entering production of the next Witcher game stronger and more ambitious than ever – and yes, we’ve got the coins to show for it! ;) pic.twitter.com/3wPTDvfD0C[December 6, 2024](https://twitter.com/vithren/status/1865030198871101558)

It features what fans think could possibly be a reference to the Curse of the Black Sun or the Conjunction of the Spheres, the cataclysm that first brought monsters like ghouls, graveirs, and vampires into The Witcher's dimension. Another [post](https://twitter.com/ThatZoidy/status/1865731621367767294) showcasing a coin then came from acting engineering manager for gameplay Jan Huňka - and it's, again, the very same coin. "The coins Mason," comments one fan, "what do they mean!!?"

There's really no telling what the coins mean just yet, especially as [CD Projekt Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/) recently made it clear that [<u>the team will be staying pretty quiet before release</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/cdpr-ceo-says-he-wants-the-witcher-4-to-drop-crumbs-to-the-community-to-whet-the-appetite-before-release/) - albeit with some "crumbs" dropped here and there to "whet the appetite" of excited players. Fans do know a few things, like the fact that the original teaser for the game, an image depicting a Witcher's medallion, [<u>features a Lynx</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-teaser-fuels-theories-that-ciri-may-replace-geralt/) - a possible nod toward the School of the Cat and Ciri.

Still can't believe we're going into production on the new Witcher game @CDPROJEKTRED pic.twitter.com/JxVnJ0B3Nv[December 8, 2024](https://twitter.com/ThatZoidy/status/1865731621367767294)

Regardless of what the coins mean, it feels like a better time now to be a Witcher stan than ever with [<u>upcoming CD Projekt Red games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-cd-projekt-red-games/) like The Witcher 4 in full swing. There's also the codenamed [<u>Project Sirius</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/cdpr-reveals-more-about-the-witcher-sirius-the-new-game-from-the-molasses-flood/), a Witcher game that developers say will "differ from past productions" at CDPR. A new story from [<u>The Witcher books</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-books/)' author Andrzej Sapkowski is out now as well, having arrived over a decade after the series' last title was released.

[<u><em>The Witcher 4 may not have Geralt after all: his actor was "slapped by CD Projekt" for accidentally sharing a rumor that he'd be in it, just not as the protagonist</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-may-not-have-geralt-after-all-his-actor-was-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-accidentally-sharing-a-rumor-that-hed-be-in-it-just-not-as-the-protagonist/)
