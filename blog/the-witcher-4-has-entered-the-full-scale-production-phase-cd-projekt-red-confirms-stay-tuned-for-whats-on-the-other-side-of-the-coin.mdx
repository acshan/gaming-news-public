[CD Projekt Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/) has confirmed that Project Polaris - which normal humans like you and me call [The Witcher 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-release-date/) - has officially "entered the full-scale production phase.""I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase," game director Sebastian Kalemba says on [Twitter](https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571). "With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!"

[Project Polaris was first announced in 2022 as the "first game" of a multi-game saga](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-is-the-first-game-of-a-multi-game-saga/). CD Projekt has been quite specific that [<em>they</em> have never called it The Witcher 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-isnt-technically-called-the-witcher-4-says-cdpr/), but in the mess of all the code names of the [upcoming CD Projekt Red games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-cd-projekt-red-games/) this is a much easier shorthand by which to remember that this is the fourth mainline Witcher game.

Development on The Witcher 4 has been rapidly expanding this year, as CD Projekt reported in May that [over 400 people were already at work on the game](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-has-over-400-people-working-on-it-already-and-cd-projekt-red-hasnt-even-entered-full-production-yet/) in whatever stage of pre-production it was in. Back in August, CDPR noted that the game [would enter the "full production phase" soon](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-has-made-substantial-progress-in-2024-and-will-soon-advance-to-the-full-production-phase/), and it seems the studio's timeline remains on track.

Besides this new mainline entry, CD Projekt is also working on two other new Witcher games in a spin-off codenamed Sirius and a remake of the original game codenamed Canis Majoris.
