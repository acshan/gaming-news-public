The final "one more thing" announcement during the [Nintendo Direct for March 2025](https://www.gamesradar.com/news/live/nintendo-direct-march-2025-everything-announced/) wasn't a game at all - instead, it was a new app called Nintendo Today that's basically set to function as a never-ending Direct.

"Get updates on all things Nintendo," as the company explains on its [official site](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-today-mobile/). "Whether it's news about the [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) system and video games, info about your favorite characters, or videos and comic strips - you'll get personalized fun every day."

The app hits [Google](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/google/) Play and the iOS App Store today, and will require a Nintendo account to use. In a press release, Nintendo says that the app will begin to feature information about its upcoming console starting after the [Nintendo Switch 2 Direct on April 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/nintendo-direct-switch-2-april-2025-guide/).

The app features a daily calendar with a variety of themes including Mario, Zelda, Pikmin, and Animal Crossing. A built-in event schedule will also provide info on "[Nintendo Direct](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/nintendo-direct/) presentations, game releases, in-game events, and more." You'll be able to customize this schedule to your preferences.

Nintendo repeatedly notes that personalization is a big factor in the app, so you'll have some control over what crosses your feed. In addition to whatever proper news the app will include, it'll also feature a fair bit of straight Nintendo-themed fun. The trailer shows off a Pikmin comic called "too stuck to pluck" and a few "pearls of wisdom" from Animal Crossing's Pascal.
