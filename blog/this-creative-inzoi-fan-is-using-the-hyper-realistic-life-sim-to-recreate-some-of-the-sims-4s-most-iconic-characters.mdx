The upcoming ultra-realistic life sim inZOI has had fans hooked for a few days with its playable character creation demo - and someone is using it to recreate iconic characters from [<u>The Sims 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-sims-4-guide/).

inZOI, the new Sims-like gem with stunning Unreal Engine 5 visuals from [<u>PUBG</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battle-royale/pubg/) developer Krafton, is impressing stans worldwide with its Character Studio - a more in-depth version of Create-A-Sim, which already has [<u>life sim fans forgetting about The Sims 4.</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-sims/after-just-1-day-inzois-hyper-realistic-character-creator-demo-on-steam-has-life-sim-fans-forgetting-about-the-sims-4-im-not-looking-back/) Everyone's been sharing their impressive creations from the demo online, from famous celebrities to [Disney](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/disney/) princesses - and, much to my delight, characters from The Sims series.

Reddit user [<u>Lost_Ambition_2792</u>](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost_Ambition_2792/) is recreating some of my favorite faces from The Sims, like Bella and Mortimer Goth - and thanks to inZOI's focus on graphical realism, the characters have never looked better. The creative mastermind has even managed to perfectly depict the entire Landgraab family - sneers and all. As a lover of all things related to vampires, I'm personally obsessed with their rendition of Vladislaus Straud.

Other fans are obsessed, too - comments show fellow demo players sharing their approval of both inZOI and the Sims 4 recreations. "They look perfect," one reads - an accurate response to leave beneath an image of Bella Goth if I do say so myself. "The Sims team will definitely have some competition with this game," writes another commenter. I'm beginning to believe so as well - I've used [<u>Sims 4 mods</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-sims-4-mods/) to make EA's game more realistic for long enough.Â
