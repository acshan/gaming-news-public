[Wildermyth](https://www.gamesradar.com/have-you-triedrunning-your-own-personal-dandd-campaign-in-wildermyth/), a beautiful, papercraft, turn-based RPG that has enough D&D stylings to keep even the most fervent [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) fan entertained has a new DLC campaign on its way that eclipses the scale of every story it's told before.

Released in 2021, Wildermyth has established itself as a cult-classic RPG. With 14,000 'Overwhelmingly Positive' Steam reviews, its combination of procedural design that mimics full-scale tabletop campaigns and deep strategy of gameplay that you might not expect from its cute papercraft art style means that even if it's not officially a Dungeons & Dragons game, it certainly captures that feeling.

Yesterday, Wildermyth released the Omenroad DLC. That includes a challenge mode complete with new maps, bosses, and augments, but it also introduces a whole new campaign. That campaign is called A Walk in the Unlight, and it uses the new formats introduced by Omenroad to spin out its story - its *very long* story.

Wondering how much content our new DLC has? One of our translators put this graph together; we think our campaign lovers will be pretty happy with the new story! ðŸ˜…#indiegame #WishlistWednesday #narrativegame pic.twitter.com/0W1csWFx0j[May 15, 2024](https://twitter.com/wildermyth/status/1790814625434402823)

In a tweet earlier this week, Wildermyth's official Twitter account showed off exactly how long that campaign is. A graph put together by one of the game's translators reveals that most of the existing stories have wordcounts hovering between the 20,000-60,000. There are a couple of outliers - one a bit shorter and another a bit longer - but they all pale in comparison to A Walk in the Unlight.

From that graph, a rough estimate suggests that the DLC campaign boasts a total wordcount just shy of 180,000. That's a beefy, novel-length story, but it's also more than most of the previous campaigns combined. The previous longest story, Cvawn, is about 75,000 words long, but the other five pre-existing campaigns combined seem to total up to around 170,000 words, making A Walk in the Unlight just a touch longer than most of the rest of the entire game.

For some, that would probably be a daunting prospect, but I'm surrounded by enough people who have put [hundreds of hours](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-made-me-break-my-lifelong-rpg-code-to-recruit-a-character-and-im-not-sure-i-can-ever-forgive-myself/) [into Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/350-hours-and-5-playthroughs-later-baldurs-gate-3-is-still-music-to-my-adhd/) that it no longer seems particularly scary. If you've seen everything that Larian has to offer, this might be the time to jump into a slightly different tabletop experience.
