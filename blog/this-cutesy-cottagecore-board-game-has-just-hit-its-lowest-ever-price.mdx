Be sure not to confuse this Mycelia from Ravensburger with its identically-titled counterpart from the publisher Split Stone Games. While both games feature super charming illustrations of fungus friends, they differ in complexity and gameplay style.

The Mycelia from Split Stone Games is more strategy focused and a tad more likely to leave casual players scratching their heads in confusion. Meanwhile, Ravensburger's Mycelia is a more family friendly deck-building game that isn't going to alienate newbies. If you do fancy a bit more of a challenge, Mycelia does provide variable difficulty.In this way, Mycelia really meets you where you're at. This makes sense, given its creator [said](https://www.thefamilygamers.com/mycelia/) that one of his core inspirations was producing an introduction to deckbuilding for his mom, who had never played anything in the genre before.

Wow, even the backstory of Mycelia is adorable. Just when I thought it couldn't get any cuter.
