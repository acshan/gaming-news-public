[Valve](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/valve/)'s [Half-Life: Alyx](https://www.gamesradar.com/half-life-alyx-tips/) is one of the defining VR games in recent years. It gives fans a follow-up they didn't quite expect, but one that still very much plays to the strengths of the series while leaving the groundwork for something new. While it is a must-play for fans of Half-Life, the need for a VR device is still a significant barrier for those without access to one tuned for PC gaming.

That's why some fans took it upon themselves to make [a special mod](https://www.gamesradar.com/you-can-now-play-all-of-half-life-alyx-without-vr-thanks-to-this-mod/) that removes the VR requirement for Half-Life: Alyx by turning it into a more traditional FPS like the earlier entries. After several years in the making, Half-Life: Alyx can be played with a PC mod that removes the VR, but many fans of the game are cautioning players not to let this be their first experience.

The mod, known as [Half-Life Alyx NoVR](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr), has been in the works for several years and presents a redesigned version of the game's narrative and action experience that is more in line with a traditional FPS. A recent [summer update ](https://x.com/HL_Alyx_NoVR/status/1822728359018684857)from the team of modders added an assortment of tweaks and additions that have finalized the "flat" experience of the game. One user on Twitter recently shared their experience playing the game, praising the mod for the opportunity to dive into the Half-Life world again.

Half-Life: Alyx NoVR is finally 100% playable. Controls, movement, Steam achievements - everything works great and the game looks sick! Thank you @HL_Alyx_NoVR! HALF-LIFE is so back and I'm glad to have the opportunity to return to this world üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª pic.twitter.com/piP5RQOb3d[November 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/Sink_yy/status/1859910902763639151)

However, the NoVR mod has sparked a debate among fans. Half-Life: Alyx was meticulously designed for the VR experience, with its narrative and gameplay beats focusing on heightened immersion and interactivity. Toning down or removing these aspects to make it work for the 'flat' experience seems counter to the game's essence. Some fans on Reddit and social media have gone as far as to say that the mod makes Alyx appear like an average FPS instead of memorable VR FPS it was originally. The game's many defining moments, such as the infamous 'Jeff' sequence, are designed with VR in mind, requiring players to use heightened situational awareness and interactivity that comes with VR to complete challenges.

"Just because you can, doesn't mean you should," [one fan says](https://x.com/Reelix/status/1860060342329704951). "To experience this game first on a flat screen, I feel, is going to ruin the game for you," [argues another](https://x.com/DukeOrbits/status/1860089385792016399).

However, there are plenty who see the benefits of the mod, too: "I'm glad that those who don't have a headset can enjoy this game," a [fan comments](https://x.com/JayJayokocha994/status/1860099765779968447).

The existence of this mod, while well-intentioned, has created an interesting debate about the recommended way to play the game. Half-Life: Alyx is a VR game through and through, yet much like the history of PC gaming ‚Äì especially with the Half-Life series - fans and modders have jumped at the opportunity to take a product and build upon it. The NoVR mod is part of a long tradition of PC modifications, yet there's no denying that something is lost when playing Half-Life: Alyx as a flat experience. But much like the PC mods, it's your discretion what you decide to do with your game.
