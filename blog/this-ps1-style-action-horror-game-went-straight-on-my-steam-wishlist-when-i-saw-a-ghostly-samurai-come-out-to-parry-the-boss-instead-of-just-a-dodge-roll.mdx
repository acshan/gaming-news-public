I love [<u>Sekiro</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/sekiro-review/) for making everyone hungry for parrying, and this PS1-style action horror game has it in spades.

[<u>Samurai Unicorn</u>](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494020/Samurai_Unicorn/) is an upcoming game that combines elements of Resident Evil, Sekiro, and Shadow of Mordor. In a clip posted to Twitter, we see the protagonist shoot a creature with a pistol. Fairly normal stuff. That is, until the creature goes in for an attack and a sword-wielding ghost erupts from the main character and parries the blow away. It's amazing.

I can't prove it, but it feels like since Sekrio came out more and more games are focused on parrying and rhythmic combat over just dodge rolling. There's a game coming out that lets you [<u>parry nukes and even the ground itself</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/i-was-already-impressed-by-this-nuke-parrying-soulslike-and-that-was-before-i-found-out-it-has-entire-cities-that-you-can-just-miss/).

another horror faux PS1 game? looks good, but-*a ghostly samurai comes out to parry the boss instead of just a dodge roll*....huh https://t.co/7BOPGAgyh3[December 2, 2024](https://twitter.com/SSStylishHuntr/status/1863410347316752712)

Of course, the Shadow of Mordor influence is clear in Samurai Unicorn, too. A ghostly apparition aiding you in combat is the main fighting mechanic of that game, and it works brilliantly.

Samurai Unicorn has a sci-fi setting, taking place within "the sprawling megacity of Sydney3," so I'm not sure why there's a samurai ghost, but hey, it looks awesome so I'm happy to go along with it. This is a video game and cool, weird things can happen in video games. "This is authentic PS1 weird," [tweets uckema](https://x.com/uckema/status/1863440811402068273).

People on Twitter seem equally as impressed/confused too. "another horror faux PS1 game? looks good, but- *a ghostly samurai comes out to parry the boss instead of just a dodge roll* ....huh," writes SSStylishHuntr.
