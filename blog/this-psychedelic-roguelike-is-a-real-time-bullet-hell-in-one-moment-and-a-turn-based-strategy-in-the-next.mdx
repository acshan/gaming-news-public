This time-bending roguelike blends some of my favorite genres in ways few often do.

As shown off at [The Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/)'s Summer Showcase, Enter the Chronosphere is a psychedelic roguelike that shifts between real-time action and turn-based tactics, offering a bullet hell experience you can pause without needing to press, well, the pause button.

Our trippy trailer shows off some of the interdimensional scraps you'll get into while playing the game. While some fights will have you working with cowboys and knives in an appropriate setting to match, others will involve something completely different – like fish who may fling a weaponized parasite your way.

What offers consistently is the gameplay. A screen-stuffing bullet hell in one moment, you can take a pause as we go turn-based to figure out your next move – be it a shot, dodge, or both in one glorious flowing action.

Even better than that is the fact you never truly leave something behind. Once you're in full swing, you can mix and match between "hundreds" of different weapons, items, and abilities to do as you wish – fancy building a playstyle around revolvers and wasps? Why not.

That's not all you'll pick up on your travels either, as you'll meet characters to add to your rag-tag crew while unlocking new missions, game modes, and more. All of this happens on your journey to discover the galaxy's greatest threat.
