Stand-Alone, a stylish roguelite in which you play as a robot sheep battling legions of wolves, will be releasing this summer, as revealed at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/).

Lifuel's debut game has you take on the role of an amnesiac guardian robot who failed to protect their sheep flock from Dr. Wolf. Now, transformed into a robo-sheep, you must avenge your flock and be a brave sheep amongst wolves. But if the summer release window is too far off, there's a playtest you can join right now.

Using a gigantic sword, you'll cleave through lupine enemies of all varieties in incredibly flashy combat, using a range of combos and abilities. After defeating certain enemies, you can then download skills from their systems and modify them to suit your playstyle, helping you create the ultimate wolf-killing build in each run, and allowing for huge variety. Obviously, since Stand-Alone is a roguelite, death means you'll lose much of what you've gained, so holding out for as long as possible is vital.

Along the way, you'll also face plenty of bosses ready to end your runs, causing you to lose your equipment. But each boss you'll defeat will get you closer to the end of the game and might lead to you uncovering more about the world and the past that led to this robo-sheep's quest for vengeance.

Stand-Alone doesn't have a precise release date just yet, but we know it'll be launching sometime in the summer this year. In the meantime, make sure you wishlist it on Steam, or even check out the playstest, and follow the game on [Twitter](https://x.com/lifuelgames) to keep up to date with any news and announcements.
