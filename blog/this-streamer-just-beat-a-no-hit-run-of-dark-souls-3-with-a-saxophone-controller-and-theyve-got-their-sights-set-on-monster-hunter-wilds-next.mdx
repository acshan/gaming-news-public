A streamer completes a world first: beating [<u>Dark Souls 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dark-souls-3-tips/) while taking no hits and playing it with a saxophone controller.

"The world's first sax-controlled no-hit run of Dark Souls 3 has been dooted," excitedly tweets streamer Dr. Doot. Beating any [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) game without taking a single hit is impressive, and doing it with a saxophone controller of all things is even more so.

I BEAT DARK SOULS 3 WITH A SAXOPHONE WITHOUT TAKING A SINGLE HIT FROM ANY ENEMY/BOSS/TRAP THE WORLD'S FIRST SAX-CONTROLLED NO-HIT RUN OF DS3 HAS BEEN DOOTED!(on my 1st stream as a Twitch Partner, no less ðŸ¥²)Sax-Controlled Dark Souls 2 Hitless is next ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ· pic.twitter.com/EBfXSOfk2E[March 1, 2025](https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1895684112931045488)

"Just when you think you're good at [<u>Dark Souls</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dark-souls-walkthrough/) people will pull this shit and completely stunt on anything you've ever done in the game," [<u>replies</u>](https://x.com/KeitrenGraves/status/1895845599129612527) one person.

In the video that shows off the final fight of the challenge, Dr. Doot dodges around the Soul of Cinder, only striking when a safe opening presents itself. It's a nail-biting battle, as Doot seems to be able to avoid the incoming flaming sword strikes by mere inches.

I didn't even know saxophone controllers existed, but Dr. Doot is very familiar with them, having previously [<u>beaten Elden Ring's toughest boss</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/watch-in-awe-as-an-elden-ring-master-playing-with-a-saxophone-that-goes-doot-finally-wrecks-malenia-in-45-seconds-without-getting-hit/), Malenia, with one in just 45 seconds and without taking a hit.

This isn't the first FromSoftware game Dr. Doot has conquered this way. They previously [<u>beat Elden Ring hitless using a saxophone controller</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-magician-who-beat-the-game-with-an-actual-saxophone-has-done-it-again-in-shadow-of-the-erdtree/), too. Their prowess with the weapon knows no limits, it seems.

Dr. Doot has now set their sights on [<u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-wilds-beginners-guide/). As well as using the saxophone controller to play, they're also using the in-game saxophone weapon to defeat all the monsters that lie in wait, probably just as shocked as we are to see someone running at them with a musical instrument instead of, you know, a sword or something.
