Strategy game Toy Tactics shows off more quirky minifigure action in a new trailer at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/), and it's available now in early access.

Published by Joystick Ventures and developed by Kraken Empire, Toy Tactics is a whimsical real-time strategy game that has you hand draw your commands for all sorts of wobbly minifigure units. The fully simulated physics system means all the toy soldiers with their rounded bases can get thrown around and knocked over, meeting their end, so send your enemies flying and you'll be sure to emerge victorious. Not only that, but the game will have online multiplayer for the full 1.0 launch.

Toy Tactics' main mechanic is the ability to physically draw formations and new commands for your toy soldiers to follow. Pause the game and draw shapes using the Brush of High Command to get your troops to exactly where you want them or to focus their fire on just the right spot.

Draw around the ridge of cliff so your archers can get up high and rain arrows on the enemy or direct your fighters to get up close and surround your foe's forces with an enveloping ring. The freeform nature of the drawing system means it's simple to pick up but allows for plenty of complex ways to command your battalions.

You won't master the art of war immediately though, so as things don't go to plan, it's nice to have spells and relics to turn the tide of battle against the various enemy factions. Skill trees let you unlock and customize your spell roster, while defeating enemies charges up other powers, letting you deploy powerful siege weapons or supportive structures to bolster and heal your army. Coupled with the physics system, your most powerful relics and spells can topple castle walls too.

While there's no launch date for a full 1.0 release, Toy Tactics is currently available in early access on PC via Steam and there's even a free demo you can try out.
