Yaoling: Mythical Journey, an enchanting creature-collecting indie gem reminiscent of iconic games like [<u>Pokemon</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/pokemon/), just released - and I think everyone should check it out.

It's not often that a game immediately catches my eye, but Rayka Studio's Yaoling: Mythical Journey certainly did. The Eastern-inspired fantasy RPG features cozy creature-collecting mechanics and strategic gameplay galore, all within a stunning fairy-tale world teeming with cute Yaolings to catch. Much like Pokemon, each Yaoling is unique - with over 300 species, there are countless abilities, appearances, and talents to discover.

These little guys can also evolve - again, just like Pokemon. Players may discover special versions of Yaolings on rare occasions, too, of different sizes, new colors, or shiny coats. It's not all comparable to [<u>Nintendo</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo/)'s own pocket monster-taming series, though - the gameplay focuses more on team-building strategy while simultaneously allowing for relaxing activities in between battles like those in [<u>Stardew Valley</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/stardew-valley-guide/). Think cooking, crafting, farming, fishing, and mining.

Yaoling doesn't pit players against gym leaders, either - demon lords run rampant throughout the game's fantastical vibrant world, but they're not ordinary enemies. Upon defeat, demon lords will transform into what they truly are - innocent Yaolings waiting to be recruited by destined keepers, the players. Once enough creatures are collected, keepers can work with them to build their village up, too - with breeding dens, restaurants, training grounds, and more available for construction.

Between Yaoling: Mythical Journey and other Pokemon-esque games like [Ova Magica](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/this-jrpg-inspired-farming-sim-ive-waited-ages-for-just-released-and-it-offers-the-coziest-pokemon-x-stardew-valley-vibes/), I'm set for the summer. If you're interested in the wholesome creature collector yourself, you can grab it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816950/Yaoling_Mythical_Journey/?curator_clanid=4777282) right now - Rayka Studio's new game currently has a "Very Positive" rating overall, and it launched into early access just a few days ago. Whether you're searching for your next comfort title or something different ahead of [<u>Pokemon Legends Z-A</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-guide/), it's worth a look.
