If you're looking for a fix of XCOM with a helping of World War 2-inspired realism and true stories, Forgotten But Unbroken is here with a Steam demo in hand.

As shown off during [The Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/)'s Summer Showcase, Forgotten but Unbroken is a turn-based strategy game that invites plenty of comparisons to XCOM itself – with soldiers dotted around a map ready to be moved or ordered to take an action. As ever, think twice about where you move someone.

Where things differ, as developer Centurion Developments shares, is a dedication to realism. There are no special abilities granted by wearables or magical healing powers here, only tactics and military might. 

On that, you'll want to ensure you stay on top of base management outside of battle. You can't heal people through magical potions, but you can send them to the med bay, after all. You can also use your base to train troops and maintain their morale. The decision is on you whether you build out hospitals or armories, though bear in mind you'll need to consider weather and disease alongside your military needs.

Centurion Developments says the story itself is based on actual events and stories. As such, you'll meet an array of characters who fought in World War 2, who have had their stories "carefully and respectfully" selected. The main story, though, is that of the main character, Commander Martin, who greatly feels the war's impact. You'll also encounter various items that link to actual events, like newspaper features that touch on events like the Battle of Kursk or the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.

If that sounds like your thing,  Forgotten But Unbroken will be released this year, [though a demo is available now](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2122090/Forgotten_but_Unbroken/).
