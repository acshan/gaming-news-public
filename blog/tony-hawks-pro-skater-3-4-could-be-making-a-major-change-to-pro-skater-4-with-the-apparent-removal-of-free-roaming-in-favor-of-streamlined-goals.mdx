After over four years, we finally have confirmation of the [Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-launches-this-july-with-new-parks-for-for-the-first-time-in-10-years-and-you-can-pre-order-to-get-a-demo-in-june/) remake I’ve been dying for since the incredible [Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1+2](https://www.gamesradar.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review-plenty-more-to-offer-than-just-trips-back-to-the-past/) remake released in 2020 - but they could be coming with a major change.

While Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and its sequel followed the same format (albeit with extra goals being added for the original maps in the remake), Pro Skater 3 and 4 were very different games. While the former followed the original two-minute run to complete as many goals as possible formula, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 ditched it for a free-roaming structure that allowed you to take on specific missions one by one by talking with NPCs.

Upon the announcement of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, players noticed an interesting line in the [blog post](https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/blog/2025/03/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-plus-four-launch-announcement) released alongside the announcement of the remake. “The parks from THPS3 and THPS4 have been authentically remade in jaw-dropping 4K resolution with streamlined goals in a two-minute format.”

While that makes total sense for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3, which followed that format, it seems to imply that Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4 has been reworked to follow the classic formula as opposed to its original free-roaming style despite claiming to be "authentically remade".

This wouldn’t be the first time the series has adapted free-roaming to the original format, as later games in the series like Tony Hawk’s Underground 2 and American Wasteland featured a ‘Classic Mode’ option that did just that.

Personally, I really wanted a classic mode option for Pro Skater 4 for this remake, as I much prefer it, but I’m not sure it’s worth having at the expense of the original formula. Of course, this panic could be all for nothing, as [Activision](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/activision/) hasn't confirmed the specifics just yet.

*One thing that is returning from the original games is the appearance of the Doom Slayer, who is available in the Tony Hawk’s *[<em>Pro Skater 3+4 Digital Deluxe edition</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-pre-orders-include-doom-slayer-and-an-actual-full-sized-skateboard/)
