That's [$17.49 against its usual $34.99 price tag](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FSuper-Meeple-Expeditions-Players-Minutes%2Fdp%2FB0D6X8M53V%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-1140782102656748042-20).

This is a delightful-looking game. One that's not only family friendly, but also easy to learn, and will sneakily teach players geography in the process. It's one of those gateway games that can enthrall even the less board game inclined.

Of course that means it won't necessarily win the hearts of board game enthusiasts who are used to extremely convoluted rulesets. It's a chill time, from what I've seen of the reviews, but with enough 'take that' action and thoughtful consideration to really give the game depth.
