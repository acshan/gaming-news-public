If you're gobbling up every crumb of pre-release [Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-red-guide/) footage you can get your hands on, you're in luck, as [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/) has just stealth dropped a few more specks of sustenance for your consumption as part of Apple's MacBook Pro announcement stream.

The clip is all of nine seconds long, and shows Naoe - the stealthier of the game's two protagonists -  sprinting across a rooftop, deploying a grappling hook, and swinging over to the outer wall of a nearby fortress. It looks quite fast and fluid, which is exactly what I'm hoping for from Naoe's gameplay. You can see it all for yourself starting at the 10:06 mark in the [video below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0cmfY7qdmY&ab_channel=Apple). 

We've gotten plenty of looks at Assassin's Creed Shadows gameplay over the summer, but peeks have dried up [since the game's delay to February.](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-after-learnings-from-the-star-wars-outlaws-release/) The game's [early access plans have also been scrapped](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-early-access-officially-canceled-as-ubisoft-drops-collectors-edition-price-by-usd50-amid-delays-and-scrapped-season-pass-plans/), so you won't be able to pay extra to get in a few days early. The February launch has [Assassin's Creed Shadows entering into what might just be a full-on RPG bloodbath](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/with-assassins-creed-shadows-pushed-back-to-an-already-full-february-expect-a-bloodbath-that-might-decide-the-future-of-rpgs/) with one of the biggest release months for the genre we've seen in ages.

Ubisoft has made clear that there's a lot riding on Assassin's Creed Shadows, particularly after the "softer than expected" sales of [Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-outlaws-guide/). There are plenty of [upcoming Ubisoft games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-ubisoft-games/) on the docket, but arguably none bigger than the next entry in the Assassin's Creed series.
