The Finals is set to land on PS4 on December 12, 2024. That's the news out of the Golden Joystick Awards – something of a surprise too, given how ambitious this free-to-play, Unreal Engine 5 FPS has proven to be since it made its debut on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X last year. 

The Finals has been one of the more dazzling entrants into the live-service arena in quite some time, with this shooter from former Battlefield developers going all-in on massive destruction and widespread mayhem. The game is set to enter its fifth season shortly, but that shouldn't put you off if you're new to the game show setup – Embark Studios has been careful to ensure that The Finals remains welcoming to new players as it builds on foundations for those who have been fighting for victory since the beginning. 

While the PS4 release date certainly caught my eye, Embark has also confirmed that a PS5 Pro patch is now live, enhancing the fast-paced action for those of you with the supercharged PlayStation. All of which is to say that there's never been a better time to jump right in and check out this compelling live-service shooter. The game has gone from strength to strength this year, and I know I'll be dragging my friends who are yet to make the jump to the new generation consoles into The Finals come December 12.
