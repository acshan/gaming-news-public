With plenty of upcoming Assassin's Creed games currently in the works, it's an exciting time for fans of [Ubisoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/ubisoft/)'s long-running stealthy series. Yes, we’ve seen a few recent delays, but we still have the first-ever mobile exclusive and the next flagship entry to look forward to.  

In fact, there are plenty of [upcoming Ubisoft games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-ubisoft-games/) on the horizon, but the most exciting is Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which is set to arrive in early 2025 after suffering from a few delays. Following the release of  [Assassin's Creed Mirage](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-mirage-guide/) last year, which delivered a tighter experience about Basim before the events of[<u> Assassin's Creed Valhalla </u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-guide/), we’re heading to Japan next in Shadows. Then we're possibly staying in Asia as we anxiously wait for Assassin's Creed Jade. 

As you can see, there are certainly many [new games](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/) to watch out for in the future. So, for a full recap of all of the upcoming Assassin's Creed games coming our way, read on below.

This roundup of upcoming Assassin's Creed games was updated on October 14, 2024, to add the news of the release date change for Assassin's Creed Shadows. 



Developer: Ubisoft Quebec Platform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5Release Date: February 14, 2025 

Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was first announced as [Assassin's Creed Codename Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-red-guide/), is expected to be the first game to join the Infinity Hub, and the sequel that will finally deliver on a longstanding fan request: it will be taking us to feudal Japan. Originally, the game was set to release in November 2024.

However, it has now been [delayed to early 2025](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-after-learnings-from-the-star-wars-outlaws-release/). Still, we're excited to get our hands on it eventually, as the upcoming adventure will let us live out a "very powerful shinobi fantasy" in an open-world RPG where we'll get to play as two different protagonists - including a real historical figure. It's a wildly exciting proposition, and we're eager to see what Ubisoft delivers here.

[Assassin's Creed Infinity](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-infinity-guide/) is difficult to explain, but it could have a transformative impact on the way that we interact with Assassin's Creed games in the future. Ubisoft is effectively building an interactive hub that will function like the Animus, allowing you to jump between different historical playgrounds while simultaneously progressing the modern-day narrative framing that has been with the series since the beginning.

We expect Infinity to launch on February 14, 2025 along with Shadows. The first two games to join the Infinity Hub will be Assassin's Creed Shadows and Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe, and it's then expected to expand and evolve over time. It's a little metaverse-y, but it also makes perfect sense for this franchise. 



Developer: Ubisoft Montreal Platform(s): TBCRelease Date: TBC

[Assassin's Creed Codename Hexe](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-guide/) is being positioned as a "a very different type of Assassin's Creed game." Details are few and far between, but we do know that it's being created by Assassin's Creed Valhalla developer Ubisoft Montreal and that former Watch Dogs Legion creative director Clint Hocking will be leading production.

The first teaser trailer and game's codename suggest that Assassin's Creed Hexe will be set in 16th-century Europe during the infamous witch trials that engulfed the region. We could be in for a weird, subversive open world RPG here with Codename Hexe, and we're honestly here for a little more experimentation from the Assassin's Creed series. 



Developer: Ubisoft Platform(s): Android, iOSRelease Date: TBC 2025

[Assassin's Creed Jade is set to be the first truly open world Assassin's Creed game for mobile](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-codename-jade-takes-the-series-to-china-for-an-open-world-game-on-mobile/). Ubisoft has said that it's trying to build an authentic Assassin's Creed experience, albeit one that is totally optimized for touch controls. Assassin's Creed Jade will be set in China in the year 215 BCE – and, yes, you will be about to parkour across the Great Wall.

Originally revealed as Codename Jade before its official title was confirmed at GamesCom 2023 as simply Assassin's Creed Jade, it will also be the first game in the series to [let you create your own assassin from scratch](https://www.gamesradar.com/assassins-creed-jade-preview-hands-on-gamescom-2023/), which is a nice touch. Currently, we expect the game to be released sometime in 2025, after Shadows.  



Developer: Ubisoft Platform(s): Android, iOSRelease Date: TBC

Ubisoft and Netflix have entered a pretty broad collaboration agreement. There's a Netflix Assassin's Creed series in production (with showrunner Jed Stuart at the helm; the writer of such iconic action movies as Die Hard and The Fugitive), and [<em>three</em> mobile games in development for Netflix's video game platform](https://www.gamesradar.com/new-assassins-creed-game-and-two-more-ubisoft-titles-coming-to-netflix-games/).

There are games based on the Valiant Hearts and Mighty Quest universes coming, and of course, one based in the world of Assassin's Creed, too. The Assassin's Creed Netflix game is in early development, but when it does launch, it'll be available exclusively on mobile to Netflix subscribers around the world. No other information was shared or has been since 2022, but our curiosity is still piqued all the same. 



Developer: Ubisoft  Platform(s): TBCRelease Date: TBC

Ubisoft says that it is "investigating how we will bring back standalone multiplayer experiences into the Assassin's Creed universe." Assassin's Creed multiplayer has been atop wish lists for years now – it's been nine years since the mode featured in AC4: Black Flag and eight since co-op appeared in Assassin's Creed Unity.

Little is known about this standalone Assassin's Creed multiplayer game, although we know that it'll launch as part of the Assassin's Creed Infinity Hub, and franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has [confirmed that the codename is 'Assassin's Creed Invictus'](https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is).
