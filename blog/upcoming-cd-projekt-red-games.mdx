There's a bunch of upcoming [CD Projekt Red](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/cd-projekt-red/) games in development right now, with the award-winning developer turning its attention to new Witcher and Cyberpunk experiences following the release of [Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-guide/). The studio is known for creating some of the [best RPGs](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-rpg-games/) in recent history, so naturally, we're incredibly excited to see what [new games](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/) it has in store for us. 

The lineup of new CDPR games includes adventures that aren't going to directly follow [The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt](https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-3-guide/), such as a [remake of Geralt's first adventure](https://www.gamesradar.com/cd-projekt-announces-the-witcher-remake/). We have a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel on the horizon, too, and that barely scratches the surface of what's to come. So, you'll want to keep reading to find more info on every one of the upcoming CD Projekt Red games in development right now.

CD Projekt Red confirmed the existence of [<u>The Witcher 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-release-date/) in March 2022, and has been quietly issuing updates ever since. We now know that The Witcher Polaris (as it is codenamed internally) will be "a story-driven open-world RPG built on the legacy of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt." The new Witcher game is in pre-production with over 150 staff involved in early development. It is being built using Unreal Engine 5 – rather than CDPR's proprietary RED Engine, which powered The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. And in truly exciting news, we know that Project Polaris is merely the start of what's to come – "the beginning of a new saga." While we are waiting for more new updates on this one, at least fans can also look forward to Netflix's [The Witcher season 4](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-season-4-release-date-cast-trailer-plot/) (likely releasing in 2025). Don't worry there are plenty of avenues to get your Geralt fix!

The Witcher Polaris is only the beginning, the first part of a "[new AAA RPG trilogy](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-4-is-the-start-of-a-new-aaa-rpg-trilogy/)". That's right, there's a new The Witcher trilogy of games in development, and CDPR has big ambitions. The original trilogy was released across eight years and offered wildly different experiences, with The Witcher available as a PC exclusive and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings never making it to PlayStation platforms. With these three new Witcher games, CDPR says it is aiming to deliver the lot "within a six-year period following the Polaris release", which should make for a more cohesive package of games.

The Witcher Sirius is a brand-new game set in The Witcher universe, which is being [developed by The Molasses Flood](https://www.gamesradar.com/who-is-developer-the-molasses-flood-cdpr-the-witcher/). That's the studio that was acquired by CDPR in 2021, and is best known for two excellent survival games: The Flame in the Flood and Drake Hollow. [CD Projekt Red says that Codename Sirius will "differ from our past productions''](https://www.gamesradar.com/cdpr-reveals-more-about-the-witcher-sirius-the-new-game-from-the-molasses-flood/), as it will be "offering multiplayer gameplay on top of a single-player experience, including a campaign with quests and a story". Expect something different then, especially with the studio teasing that this will be "an innovative take on The Witcher universe". [Development of The Witcher Sirius was reportedly rebooted](https://www.gamesradar.com/one-of-the-new-witcher-games-appears-to-have-been-completely-rebooted/), with The Molasses Flood going back to the drawing board in collaboration with the wider CDPR team to ensure that this game can deliver on its promise.

While CDPR will be hard at work on its new trilogy of games, it will be enlisting the help of outside studios to continue expanding The Witcher universe. Originally codenamed [The Witcher Canis Majoris](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-canis-majoris/), CD Projekt Red has now revealed it's actually a Witcher Remake - a full remake of the original Witcher game that will be a "modern reimaging". For this one CDPR will be collaborating with an "external studio headed by experienced developers who have worked on past Witcher games", and that studio is Fool's Theory. 

It's going to be created using Unreal Engine 5 - just like The Witcher 4 - but warning, CDPR says it's "gonna be a while until we can share more details".

Had you asked us a few years ago, we'd have speculated that we'd never see a [Cyberpunk 2077 sequel](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion/). But after years of careful improvements and updates, it would appear that CD Projekt Red has found some stability in Night City. After surging past 20 million copies sold this year, not to mention [<u>beating The Witcher 3's all-time concurrent player record on steam</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-beats-the-witcher-3s-all-time-concurrent-player-record-on-steam/), CDPR has put a new game into production. Cyberpunk Orion is described by the studio as a "Cyberpunk 2077 sequel that will prove the full power and potential of the Cyberpunk universe," with the company adding that it plans to "take the Cyberpunk franchise further and continue harnessing the potential of this dark fantasy universe." No other information is available, but expect Cyberpunk 2077 Orion to release well after The Witcher Polaris.

If CD Projekt Red weren't already content with developing a new trilogy of Witcher games and a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, it's also working on another project. The studio says that it has been working on a "standalone IP distinct from The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077" since 2021. [Project Hadar is being developed in-house by CDPR](https://www.gamesradar.com/cd-projekt-working-on-a-new-ip/), and it's still in the conceptual phase. "Hadar is a codename for a third, entirely distinct IP, created from scratch within CDPR. The project is in the earliest stages of the creative process, which means we are not developing any game yet, but working exclusively on the foundation for this new setting." Expect updates on Project Hadar to be a long way off.
