This list of upcoming indie games was updated on April 9, 2024 to add the release dates for Hauntii and Paper Trail. 



Release date: April 25, 2024
Platform(s):  PC, Switch 

You know what they say, one crab's trash is another crab's treasure. Okay, maybe they don't say that about crabs per se, but it's definitely true in the case of [Another Crab's Treasure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887840/Another_Crabs_Treasure/). Developer Aggro Crab is bringing us a new souls-like experience under the sea as a crustacean called Krill who's on the hunt for treasure to buy back his repurposed shell. In the polluted underwater world, trash is considered to be a valuable resource that's used for just about everything, but it also brings with it an infection known as the Gunk which threatens the ocean. If you're on the lookout for a new souls-like experience – featuring a whole lot of crabs, no less – this is one adventure to watch out for.

[Paper Trail](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889740/Paper_Trail/) looks like a charming new puzzle adventure that takes place in a paper world.

Developed by Newfangled Games, Paper Trail is set to explore the story of Paige who's just about to leave home for the first time to pursue her studies as an up and coming academic.

[Hauntii](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060790/Hauntii/) is an eye-catching upcoming adventure from developer Moonloop Games that sees you take on the role of a ghost in search of answers. What makes Hauntii so unique, though, is that it's actually a twin-stick shooter that's designed to be taken at a slower pace. Using twin-stick controls to blast past foes and navigate through obstacles, you can also possess all manner of objects in the world to use or play around with as you puzzle your way through the mysterious setting known as Eternity.
