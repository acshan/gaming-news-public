There are loads of upcoming Marvel games on the horizon and we're psyched for every single one. Last year saw the release of the much-anticipated spidey sequel [Marvel's Spider-Man 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-spider-man-2-guide/), but there are plenty of new Marvel projects in the works from myriad top developers that will put some major Marvel characters in the spotlight. We're talking Wolverine, Blade, Iron Man, and a [WW2-era Marvel game from Skydance New Media](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-captain-america-and-black-panther-ww2-game-is-officially-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-and-its-out-next-year/) that sees Captain America teaming up with Black Panther. As if they weren't cool enough on their own.

Now that it's finally got a name, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is set to join the legions of stellar Marvel games that have launched in years past, from digital card collector Marvel Snap to the story-driven likes of [Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-guide/), the tactical RPG [Marvel's Midnight Suns](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-midnight-suns-review/), and loads of others. Rise of Hydra will be in good company, too; as seen from the unfortunate [Insomniac leak](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-wolverine-leak-rapidly-spreads-online-1-week-after-marvels-spider-man-studio-insomniac-suffers-huge-data-breach/) that spilled the Spider-Man studio's future release schedule, plans for [new games](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/) are not in short supply. For now, though, we'll be sticking to the official information and announcements as given by developers to bring you a look at all the upcoming Marvel games coming in 2024 and beyond.

This roundup of upcoming Marvel games was updated on October 15, adding Marvel Rivals to the list and making sure all information is up to date.



Developer: NetEase GamesPlatform(s): PS5, PC, Xbox Series X Release Date: December 6, 2024

[Marvel Rivals](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-guide/) is for all you MCU fans who have been looking for a superpowered gaming experience like Overwatch to pass the time. Here is a team-based PVP shooter that lets you face off and embody your favorite characters across the [Marvel timeline](https://www.gamesradar.com/mcu-timeline-marvel-movies-tv-shows/) in colorful and fast-paced 6v6 matches. Marvel Rivals is breaming with creative potential as it promises unique team compositions, has stunning visuals, and celebrates figures from the comics that haven't gotten the big screen treatment yet (we're looking at you, Jeff the Land Shark). This is also the only Marvel game scheduled to release in 2024, so it’s worth having on your radar if you are searching for a holiday pick-me-up this December.



Developer: Skydance MediaPlatform(s): TBCRelease Date: TBC 2025

Despite being announced without a title back in 2022, we finally know that Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the name of Skydance Media's upcoming action game that sees Captain America gingerly teaming up with Black Panther.

The title was unveiled in a story trailer screened during March 2024's State of Unreal showcase, giving us our first proper look at the WW2-era hero epic that's slated to launch in 2025. The stunning cinematic trailer introduces us to a war-torn occupied Paris, and with Cap and T'Challa kicking things off in a decidedly unfriendly fashion, it looks like Uncharted's Amy Hennig is working her magic once again to deliver a rich historical action experience – this time, with superheroes. Excited doesn't begin to cover it.



Developer: Motive StudioPlatform(s): TBCRelease Date: TBC 

EA has announced that it is collaborating with Marvel Games to create an "all-new single-player, third-person, action-adventure Iron Man video game." Motive Studio is leading development – that's the team behind [Star Wars Squadron](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-squadrons-review/) and the [Dead Space Remake](https://www.gamesradar.com/dead-space-remake-guide/) – with [Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-guide/) executive producer Olivier Proulx. This new EA Iron Man game [entered full production in February 2023](https://www.gamesradar.com/eas-iron-man-game-has-officially-started-production/), and [Motive promises that](https://www.ea.com/news/all-new-iron-man-video-game) "the game will feature an original narrative that taps into the rich history of Iron Man, channeling the complexity, charisma, and creative genius of Tony Stark, and enabling players to feel what it’s like to truly play as Iron Man."



Developer: [Insomniac Games](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/insomniac-games/)Platform(s): PS5Release Date: TBC 

[Marvel's Wolverine](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-wolverine-guide/) is one of the biggest [<u>PS5 exclusives</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-exclusives/) on the (most likely) distant horizon. Honestly, we're happy to wait; it's been over a decade since the release of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and we've been desperately anticipating Logan's return to the world of video games ever since. Marvel's Wolverine is being developed by the team behind Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, so we're expecting a fantastically fast-paced action game with appropriately brutal combat. Let the waiting game begin!



Developer: Cliffhanger GamesPlatform(s): TBCRelease Date: TBC

We found out about this upcoming Marvel game in January 2023, when EA announced that it was publishing a [single-player Black Panther game](https://www.gamesradar.com/ea-black-panther-game-announcement/) with new in-house studio, Cliffhanger Games. It's a solo adventure set in the world of Wakanda's kingly hero, and with the publisher promising us even "greater control" over his fate than we are used to in narrative games, this is one title worth keeping an eye on. However, keep in mind that we haven't heard any news for months now, so we may be waiting a while for any substantial updates here.



Developer: [Arkane Lyon](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/arkane-studios/)Platform(s): TBCRelease date: TBC

Arkane Lyon, of Deathloop and Dishonored fame, is turning its hand to creating [Marvel's Blade](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-blade-guide/). It's going to be a "mature", single-player, third-person adventure with an original story set in a quarantined area of Paris in the middle of a supernatural emergency of a vampiric nature. The team at Arkane is seeing this as an opportunity to take its game-making into a more modern direction. When Arkane Lyon's games are already at the forefront of innovation, that makes this project even more exciting.
