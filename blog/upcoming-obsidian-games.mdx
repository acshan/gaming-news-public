With last year having been a quiet one for the developer, these upcoming Obsidian games have our full attention in 2024. We're more than ready to get stuck into another lush new world with all the complex storytelling Obsidian is known for – after all, it's been quite some time since [Grounded](https://www.gamesradar.com/grounded-tips/) and Pentiment impressed us on [Xbox Game Pass](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-xbox-game-pass-deals-sales/) back in 2022. There's one game slated to join countless other [new games](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/) next year in 2025. And after news of delays and months of waiting, it's safe to say we're anxious to learn more about what Obsidian has been cooking up for us.

The Fallout New Vegas studio was acquired by [Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) in 2018, meaning the titles listed below are expected to launch exclusively on its flagship Xbox Series X console and PC platforms. For that reason, they're definitely top of the list when it comes to the [upcoming Xbox games](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-xbox-series-x-games/) to keep an eye on as we venture further into 2024. Here's a closer look at every upcoming Obsidian game we currently know to be in development while we await more news from the studio, starting with one that's tied to a well-loved fantasy IP.

This living list of upcoming Obsidian games was updated on October 15, adding in the new release date for Avowed and making sure all the infromation below is up to date. 



Release date: February 18, 2025Platform(s): PC, Xbox Series X

Originally slated to launch in 2024 before [being delayed](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-reportedly-delayed-to-early-2025-as-xbox-moves-the-obsidian-rpg-out-of-the-way-of-stalker-2/), [Avowed](https://www.gamesradar.com/avowed-guide/) is still one of the most anticipated [<u>Xbox exclusives</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-exclusives/), and for good reason! [Obsidian Entertainment](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/obsidian-entertainment/) is returning to the world of Eora – the universe that the studio's stunning Pillars of Eternity games are set in – for a first-person, swords and shields RPG. With a wide world to explore, the option to imbue your character build with magic, and the promise of branching dialogue options, it really does sound like Obsidian is setting out to craft its very own Elder Scrolls-style adventure. A gameplay reveal in January 2024 gave us a closer look at its fantastical setting, magic-melee combat, and the mysterious story underpinning our choice-led journey, so now it's a matter of waiting patiently for February 2025 to arrive.



Release date: TBCPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X

[The Outer Worlds 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-outer-worlds-2-guide/) is still a long, *long* way away, but that doesn't mean we can't start losing our minds with a little unbridled anticipation. Obsidian announced its sequel to The Outer Worlds back in 2021, with a rather amusing trailer announcing that The Outer Worlds 2 was so early in development that it hadn't even finalized the design of the main character – let alone anything else. Still, there is good reason to get excited by the game's existence; Obsidian says it will be a "New star system; New crew; Same Outer Worlds", and we know that the RPG will be in development on Epic's impressive Unreal Engine 5 platform. One bit of disappointing news for players of the first game, it does appear that The Outer Worlds 2 won't launch on Nintendo Switch or PS5 as it's being published by [Xbox Game Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/xbox-game-studios/).
