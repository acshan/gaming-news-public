Visions of Mana won't include a multiplayer mode like its predecessors at launch, but the game's producer has toyed with the idea of reintroducing co-op to the series "in the future."

Visions of Mana aims to be a [return to form](https://www.gamesradar.com/after-16-years-visions-of-mana-brings-back-back-original-creator-koichi-ishii-for-a-return-to-its-action-rpg-roots/) for the long-running Mana series after the mainline entries went on hiatus in 2006. That means the familiar action-RPG goodness, whimsical soundscape, and squishy monsters are making a comeback on consoles for the first time in over a decade, but multiplayer sadly won't be joining the fun.

"When I played Secret of Mana, the multiplayer co-op mode was something that really stood out and left a strong impression on me," producer Masaru Oyamada says in an interview with [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/visions-of-mana-wont-have-multiplayer-but-producer-masaru-oyamada-wants-to-implement-features-like-that-in-the-future/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=socialflow/), later explaining that there were in fact discussions about incorporating co-op into Visions of Mana early in production.

"As things kind of developed further internally, we had discussions on the various things that you can do through a multiplayer mode, but also some challenges a multiplayer mode introduces," Oyamada continues, expressing concern over how multiple players would affect world design and pacing. 

While multiplayer is a glaring omission in Visions of Mana, Oymada doesn't rule it out for future outings: "When I think about the series and look towards the future, I myself really do cherish and have fond memories of being able to go on one single adventure with your friends and clear things together. I know what that experience is like, and I do want to consider being able to implement features like that in the future."

Visions of Mana is launching sometime this summer on PC, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

*Oymada previously stated that *[<em>he wanted to make Visions of Mana for 10 years, but thought no one would want it.</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/visions-of-mana-producer-wanted-to-make-the-new-jrpg-for-10-years-but-wasnt-sure-anyone-wanted-it/)
