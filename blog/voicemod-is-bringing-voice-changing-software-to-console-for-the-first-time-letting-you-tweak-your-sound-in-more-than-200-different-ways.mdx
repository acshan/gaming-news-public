Voicemod is set to change the way your play social games, with its leading voice-changing software having made the jump from desktops to PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch.

Up until recently, voice changers like this were limited to PC, but the Voicemod Key dongle has a workaround. As shown off at the [Future Games Show](https://www.gamesradar.com/future-games-show/) Spring Showcase Live from GDC, it uses a USB connection to plug into your phone or tablet, and then two audio jacks to connect between your headset and your console.

Once you've locked in, you can use the Voicemod's soundboard and real-time voice changer in console chat with no extra steps. Whether you're trying to convince your crewmates that you're not the imposter in Among Us (you definitely are) or shotcalling like a pro in Marvel Rivals or Overwatch 2, Voicemod will alter your voice with ultra-low latency and minimal resource use.

There are more than 200 programmed mods right now, from gender shift to singing voices, and you can join in with the community to take advantage of trending sounds and voices. Or, you can create your own voices in seconds using Voicelab!

Voicemod is compatible with iOS 16 and Android 8.1 or higher. If you're an existing monthly or lifetime Pro member, the Key will set you back $25, and if you're a new arrival, you can get the Voicemod Key and an annual subscription as part of a $36 bundle.
