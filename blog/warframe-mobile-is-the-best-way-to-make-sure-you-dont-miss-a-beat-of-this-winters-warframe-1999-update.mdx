With so much to explore as you search out new customisable Warframes, finding the time to play can be hard. Which is where Warframe Mobile comes in – it lets you play wherever and whenever you are. Available on iOS, it features both cross platform play and cross platform saves with the console version of the game, so that even on the go everything you do counts. 

That freedom to play anywhere with Warframe Mobile will be crucial as Warframe: 1999 approaches – the newest update coming out on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Mobile in Winter 2024. This free content will see you play as Arthur Nightingale, tearing through the Y2K-era city state of Höllvania, using a turbo-charged Atomicycle to pull off stunts as you fight.



Welcome to [Mobile Gaming Week 2024](https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/mobile-gaming/gamesradar-presents-mobile-gaming-week-2024/), where we explore what's hot, what's best, and what's next in the world of mobile gaming following the Mobile Gaming Showcase.

As well as this all new period setting, Warframe: 1999 will see you take on all new enemies, find and use powerful weapons, as well as master a tactical new Warframe – Cyte-09, a military Protoframe sporting an army uniform style look and packing an Exalted Sniper Rifle.

But there's more to Warframe: 1999 than just new gear, as you team up with six different iconic Protoframes in this new alternate world. Such as a twisted, boy band themed hunt for Technocyte Coda, an Infested Liche variation of Warframe's 90’s boy band On-lyne. You'll also be able to get to know the six new Protoframes better, developing your bond through the Hex Relationship System, as you use a retro messenger system to communicate with an all star cast including [Baldur's Gate 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/)'s Amelia Tyler and [Final Fantasy XVI](https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-16-review/)'s Ben Starr. 

With so much new content, challenges and more to take on, Warframe on Mobile gives you the freedom to play anywhere, and makes sure you're always ready to loot and shoot.
