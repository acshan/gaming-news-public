The developer behind Mario & Luigi: Brothership has finally been revealed, and folks, I'm happy to say Nintendo's upcoming RPG seems to be in good hands.

The reputable Nintendo enthusiast Twitter account Nintendeal shared a screenshot of what appears to be a disclaimer from the eShop that reveals Acquire to be the development team on Mario & Luigi: Brothership.

CONFIRMED: Mario & Luigi Brothership was co-developed by Acquire (Octopath Traveler, Tenchu, Way of the Samurai) pic.twitter.com/MNZvtqdcPE[October 21, 2024](https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1848377416328323547)

For the uninitiated, Acquire is a veteran RPG developer founded almost 30 years ago that's primarily known for the Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series, and perhaps most importantly here, for co-developing [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/)'s highly acclaimed Octopath Traveler JRPGs.

In fairness, not every Acquire-developed game has necessarily been met with acclaim (I'm looking straight at you, Akiba's Beat), but it is a very prolific and long-running studio with more hits than misses, and being so closely attached to such a generational JRPG in Octopath Traveler 2 certainly elevates its pedigree a fair deal.

Nintendo has been characteristically quiet about who's making Mario & Luigi: Brothership since [the game was announced back in June](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/mario-and-luigi-brothership-is-the-first-new-entry-in-the-rpg-series-in-almost-9-years-and-it-boasts-evolved-bros-moves/). The first new Mario & Luigi game in almost nine years hits Nintendo Switch on November 7, but we had a chance to go hands-on with it earlier this month. Definitely read our full [Mario & Luigi: Brothership hands-on preview](https://www.gamesradar.com/RPG/mario-and-luigi-brothership-preview-hands-on/) for more on that, but I'll leave you with this brief snippet in case you have any doubts.

"Mario & Luigi: Brothership doesn't reinvent Mario. It doesn't need to. My short time with Brothership was underscored by some proper laughs and grins at the unapologetic fun packed into almost every scene."
