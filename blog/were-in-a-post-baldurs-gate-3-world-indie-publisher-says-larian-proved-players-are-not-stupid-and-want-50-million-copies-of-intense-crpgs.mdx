Ever since [<u>Baldur's Gate 3</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/baldurs-gate-3-guide/) released two eternities ago, in 2023, the video game industry has been at cold war with itself over how much the intensely successful D&D 5e adaptation has changed the landscape, [<u>if at all</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/bioware-veteran-says-the-impact-of-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-more-muted-than-most-realize-because-it-was-a-perfect-storm-of-development-most-other-rpgs-wont-be-allowed-to-replicate/). But if you ask New Blood Interactive co-founder Dave Oshry, the answer is simple: everything's different after Baldur's Gate 3.

"We're in, like, a post-Baldur's Gate 3 world," Oshry says on a new episode of the [<u>Quad Damage Podcast</u>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDr5f6jBxLo). Developer Larian has "proven that people are not stupid, they don't want dumbed down RPGs, and that publishers can "sell 50 million copies of a deep-ass CRPG that will take you fucking months to beat."

"I think that means that we can do this," Oshry concludes, "and [Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) should fund a Pillars [of Eternity] 3."

Another installment of the 2015, so-called Baldur's Gate spiritual successor Pillars of Eternity would be a perfect litmus test for how much influence Larian has had on gaming; series director Josh Sawyer [<u>said in 2024</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/fallout-new-vegas-rpg-veteran-josh-sawyer-says-he-didnt-recognize-myself-during-pillars-of-eternity-2-development-i-was-this-huge-awful-ahole/) that Pillars of Eternity 2, which released in 2018, was met with poor sales that were "very demoralizing."

It's possible that, now, Baldur's Gate 3 – which shares both its tabletop inspiration and the hefty, chocolate cake denseness of its story with Pillars – has made players hungry for more demanding CRPGs. Creeping out from Larian's shadow, a new Pillars game could perform much better financially in 2025 than it did nearly a decade ago.

But, though Oshry tells Quad Damage that "Josh really wants to do Pillars 3," [<u>Sawyer once said in a 2024 Q&amp;A</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3s-success-doesnt-make-fallout-new-vegas-director-josh-sawyer-want-to-make-pillars-of-eternity-3-because-hes-out-of-step-with-the-rpgs-audience/) that while "people talked about [Pillars 3] because BG3 was a huge critical hit, a huge commercial hit," he feels that he's "kind of out of touch with that [CRPG] audience." So we'll just have to settle for [<u>Baldur's Gate 4</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/dandd-owner-hasbro-is-already-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-the-next-baldurs-gate-game-and-hopes-its-not-another-25-years-before-it-comes-out/) in 30 years.

[<u>10 years later, in a post-Baldur's Gate 3 and Avowed world, Obsidian is giving its own throwback CRPG Pillars of Eternity a turn-based combat mode.</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/10-years-later-in-a-post-baldurs-gate-3-and-avowed-world-obsidian-is-giving-its-own-throwback-crpg-pillars-of-eternity-a-turn-based-combat-mode/)
