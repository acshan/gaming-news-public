April 17 - 12PM ET: We've given our tracker a sweep and checked various retailers for stock updates. We've also tweaked some of our thoughts in regards to availability, taking into account patterns since the handheld's launch.

The PlayStation Portal stock situation appears to be improving, as GameStop still has handhelds available right now. The "Add to Cart" button only reappeared this week following a period of it being out of stock, but there's a chance it'll refuse to work if supplies have secretly dried up. We're keeping a close eye on the retailer's availability to save you any shopping hassle, so if you're in doubt about picking up the portable, it's wise to check back here for a rundown.

It's worth noting that PlayStation Portal stock is also technically available at the likes of Walmart and Amazon. However, both online stores are occupied by third party listings with inflated price tags, and unless you're desperate to pick up [Sony](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/sony/)'s [best gaming handheld](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-gaming-handheld/) contender, we'd hang fire for now. If you happen to be in the UK, you'll have a much easier time finding the remote player at MSRP, with reliable retailers like Very and EE maintaining stock at normal prices.

The [PlayStation Portal](https://www.gamesradar.com/playstation-portal-review/) has been difficult to get hold off following its launch last year, and it was largely out of stock for a chunk of 2024. Now that stock is trickling back onto shelves, grabbing Sony's $199 / £199 remote player should be less of a chore, but the situation still seems to be changing day by day. Luckily, we know a thing or two about sniffing out in demand products, and we're rounding up all the places you should check for PlayStation Portal stock to help you quickly grab any handhelds that pop up.

In stock now
GameStop is currently showing an 'Add to Cart' option, and it seems to be working! In the last few days we've seen it out of stock, and an "Add to Card" option that didn't work. GameStop had a strong allocation of PlayStation Portal units from release day, but it might be worth jumping on this quickly in case they're running short.

Best Buy has been ramping up its PlayStation Portal stock drops recently, going back to back in recent days. Things are hot here, so it's always worth checking in first. Sign in ahead of time for your best chance at scooping up a handheld quick.

A quick update: Best Buy is currently saying that the PlayStation Portal is unavailable nearby, so it's worth checking your local area. You may just get lucky!

Amazon is on a roll right now, regularly offering new PlayStation Portal stock in the last week. However, te only supplier on the world's largest retailer is a third-party one that's upped the price by a fair chunk. Unless this is your only option, we would go for another retailer that has Portal stock closer to MSRP.


At the time of writing (April 16), an Amazon third-party seller is trying to shift the Portal for almost $300. That's an absurdly inflated price, so don't give them the satisfaction! It should be back and at a normal price again soon.

If you want to head straight to the source you'll be going to Sony's PlayStation Direct page. Stock is also out here at the moment, but was available very recently.

Last restock: March 28
Walmart started out with a pretty good supply of PlayStation Portal devices, but that quickly dwindled towards the end of last year. We'd recommend Walmart Plus members keep a close eye here, as the store has been known to offer private stock drops for these customers during major sales in the past.

Watch out for those third party sellers listing PlayStation Portals on Walmart's site, with incredibly inflated price tags - don't buy them, they're not worth it.

Target has been active recently, with its most recent PlayStation Portal stock drop landing within the last couple of weeks. For now, Target seems to be out of stock on Portals, but since they serve such a wide bracket of shoppers, it might be worth keeping an eye on them if all else fails.

EE has the PlayStation Portal on the shelves, after dropping out of the race entirely for a period of weeks. That means we don't know how long this allocation will last, so we wouldn't wait too long to dive in.

Very has the PlayStation Portal in stock, though this one's a pre-order. That means you're securing your handheld, but you'll be waiting until April 19 for it to ship.

Currys is back in the PlayStation Portal stock game, with the handheld available to buy right now. We don't know how long this stock will last, though.

Annoyingly, the official PlayStation Direct page has run out of stock after a good run. Keep an eye on this one, as it could come back soon.

Amazon's most recent PlayStation Portal restock took place last week, and while it's currently unavailable we expect to see more units up for grabs shortly.

Game has run out of its current PlayStation Portal stock roll, making it the first retailer to drop out of this week's race. 

<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8150600-15618761?sid=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3340839" data-link-merchant="argos.co.uk"">Argos
Last restock: December 18
Argos is allowing us to add the PlayStation Portal to cart, but offering no collection options right now. It's well worth checking your delivery postcode, though, as your local depot could have had an influx. Argos has been fairly active over the weekend, offering fleeting chances to buy PlayStation Portal. However, that stock is assigned by post code.




Sony was confident that more PlayStation Portal stock would be available in 'early December' across the US. We have seen several stores offering new units in the last couple of days, but these drops are particularly fleeting. Until the holidays are over, we would expect this stock drought to continue, relenting in the first couple of months of 2024.

The PlayStation Portal price is $199.99 / £199.99 / AU$329.95. If you see it selling for more than that, it's likely to be a third-party scalper trying to make you fall for an overpriced unit.

The PlayStation Portal is a pricey remote player, but if you regularly find yourself without rights to the TV in the evenings it could be a godsend. The tablet is wrapped by a DualSense controller giving you the full PS5 experience without having to take up the big screen, giving it a boost in functionality and ease of use over cheaper alternatives like the [Backbone One](https://www.gamesradar.com/backbone-one-review/) or [GameSir G8 Galileo](https://www.gamesradar.com/gamesir-g8-galileo-review/) mobile controllers (and the phone you'll need to run it). However, the PlayStation Portal is only for those who already have a PS5 as it requires the console itself to do all the heavy lifting, simply casting the on-screen action to your Portal device. If you don't have a PS5, you shouldn't buy the PlayStation Portal.
