[Final Fantasy](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/jrpg/final-fantasy/) hasn't always had the best luck when it comes to big screen adaptations, but the series' producer and director of the original Final Fantasy 7 still hopes that someone can do it justice with another movie.

[Video game movie adaptations](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-video-game-movies/) are all the rage right now. Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is tearing it up in theatres. The Super Mario Bros. Movie made serious bank for Nintendo. And everything from [The Legend of Zelda](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-announces-live-action-zelda-movie/) to [Helldivers is getting the blockbuster treatment](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/sony-has-just-announced-a-helldivers-2-film-adaptation-following-the-games-record-breaking-release-but-fans-are-saying-the-same-thing/) as we speak. So it seems like the idea has been on Final Fantasy producer Yoshinori Kitase's mind, too.

When asked about the possibility of a movie adaptation in a chat with [Danny Peña](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFpVyK1mOF0&list=PL6131eG2y0-DzWByPNNy2G8sLe2EL12os&index=2), Kitase says that [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) "don't have anything officially planned" and "no talks have been had" with filmmaking talent, per a translator. But he's still "seen and heard about various Hollywood directors and actors playing Final Fantasy 7, and many creators respect the title."

The streets also apparently say that at least a few filmmakers want to take on the challenge of making a movie based on Cloud and Co's adventures. "I've been hearing things about creators out there who are very interested in the property who love the Final Fantasy 7 universe," Kitase continues. "And so, yeah, personally, I would love to see something come out of these creators in terms of a cinematic or some kind of visual piece."

Square Enix has, of course, dipped its toes into these waters before. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was the company's first go at a feature length movie that absolutely bombed on account of how little it had to do with anything that's recognizably 'Final Fantasy' and also, err, because it was bad. Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children then aimed to continue the series' most well-known story in 2005, and despite middling reviews at the time, people look back on it quite fondly. (I think about [Tifa landing on a wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqZ1kN4Wkdw) mid-fight at least once a day.) And there was also an oft-forgotten Final Fantasy 15 tie-in that was pretty alright, too.
