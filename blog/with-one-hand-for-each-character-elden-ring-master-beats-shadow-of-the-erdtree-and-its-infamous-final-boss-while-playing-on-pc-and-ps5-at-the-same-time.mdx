Elden Ring streamer BioticNova recently performed the video game equivalent to high-risk neurosurgery by beating two copies of Shadow of the Erdtree at the same time.

Yes, that's right: BioticNova defeated the ancient evil that is Shadow of the Erdtree's [<u>final boss Radahn</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-radahn-final-boss/) twice simultaneously, with their attention torn between a PC monitor and a PS5 monitor, and their hands fluttering around two different controllers. I hardly made it out of my scrap with Miquella's consort, and I kept both of my – admittedly infirm and cowardly – hands tight around just one single controller. BioticNova's clearly capable of some next-level multitasking.

"I wasn't sure how we were gonna do Radahn," the streamer [<u>says modestly on Twitter</u>](https://x.com/BioticNova/status/1888988440668041372), "but we did it!" In the accompanying clip, we see as BioticNova shifts their attention from one game to the other, seeming to only press a controller when their eyes are on the game it corresponds to. Using the Sword Lance and Blood Tax Ash of War, which helps trigger boss-melting bleed buildup, BioticNova ultimately slices through the two Radahns within 30 seconds of each other.

"Totally first try, guys," BioticNova says sarcastically [<u>during the three-hour stream</u>](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2377486122?filter=all&sort=time). "That was rough. [...] I wish it was a little bit more smooth." Sorry, I didn't notice any issues – I was too distracted by the fact that you beat two copies of Shadow of the Erdtree at nearly the exact same time.

Now we know that BioticNova's ability to destroy Dark Souls 3 boss Pontiff Sulyvahn on, again, two different games simultaneously [<u>wasn't just luck</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/this-streamer-playing-dark-souls-3-twice-at-the-same-time-might-be-the-luckiest-player-ever/) like we thought in 2023, but also is an otherworldly skill that will no doubt make Nightreign matchmaking impossible.

[<u><em>Elden Ring Nightreign beta codes are finally being sent out, but many PS5 and Xbox Series X players are reporting the same issue – they've seemingly got access to the wrong platform</em></u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-codes-are-finally-being-sent-out-but-many-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-players-are-reporting-the-same-issue-theyve-seemingly-got-access-to-the-wrong-platform/)
