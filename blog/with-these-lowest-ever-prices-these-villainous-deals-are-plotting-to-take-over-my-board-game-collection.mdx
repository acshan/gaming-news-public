Just when you thought you'd seen the limits of Disney's influence, the big mouse went and took the board game world by storm with Villainous, its range of family-friendly asymmetrical strategy games based on the dark side of the Disney, Star Wars, and Marvel universes. While mainline Villainous titles allow up to four players to take up the role of cinematic baddies, the Villainous expandalone games usually contain two villains instead. As a result of their smaller scope, they are easier to learn to play, have a reduced price point, and will take up a decent bit less space in your board game collection. I can say from experience, that last factor is a big ol' win if you too have a tiny apartment but can't help falling in love with new board games.

While Villainous expandalone games can put a fun twist on your usual Villianous experience, these titles can be played separately from the core Disney Villainous, Marvel Villainous, and Star Wars Villainous games. As a matter of fact, you don't have to have ever played any of the original Villainous installments to get to grips with these spin-offs. So, all the [best Disney Villianous expansions ](https://www.gamesradar.com/disney-villainous-expansions-guide/)are ready for you to dive into whether you've played Disney Villainous previously or not.However, there are plenty of benefits to mixing sets of Villains together. The only issue you might run into with this mix-and-match approach is that villains have to be from the same cinematic universe. For example, villains from Star Wars Villainous and its spin-offs can't be pitted against those from Marvel or Disney. Beyond that though, go nuts – it feels good to be bad!
