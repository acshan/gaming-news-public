[Microsoft](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/microsoft/) has now dated its next Xbox Developer Direct showcase for January 23, where developers themselves will get on camera to give us the rundown on medieval prequel [Doom: The Dark Ages](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-guide/), third-person action-platformer South of Midnight, turn-based RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and a "surprise" brand new game that's currently under wraps - all launching into Game Pass.

Per the [Xbox Wire announcement](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/09/xbox-developer-direct-2025/), the show will be available to stream on [YouTube](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/youtube/) and Twitch on January 23 at 10am PT, 1pm ET, and 6pm for those in the UK. Following the show's usual format, we'll be map-hopping between the different studios to get more gameplay clips, trailers, and dev vlogs. People from the Canada-based We Happy Few makers Compulsion Games, the Texas-based id Software wizards, and the French-located Sandfall Interactive will all be on-camera.

That aside, Microsoft is remaining tight-lipped on exactly what will be revealed, but since all of these games are still coming "this year," you can expect at least a couple of release dates to show up.

Then there's that mysterious fourth game. In 2023's Direct, the publisher shadow-dropped the incredible rhythm slasher Hi-Fi Rush on the very same day. And in 2024, [Square Enix](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/square_enix/) made a surprise appearance to show more from Visions of Mana. So, 2025's surprise could very well come from a team in or outside of [Microsoft's now-too-huge roster of studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-game-studios-microsoft/).

Many are speculating the [Oblivion remaster that was leaked in the FTC's lawsuit](https://www.gamesradar.com/oblivion-and-fallout-3-remasters-are-reportedly-in-development/) might show up, especially off the back of fresh reports, but between Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2, and Fable, one has to wonder how many big-name RPGs Microsoft can fit within a single calendar year. We only have so much time on our hands here, y'know? 

Microsoft Gaming's head of studios, Matt Booty, also previously said [the company didn't want to get in GTA 6's way with its 2025 slate](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/with-fable-and-doom-the-dark-ages-coming-in-2025-xbox-lead-wants-to-avoid-the-elephant-in-the-room-many-are-going-to-plan-around-gta-6/), which might explain why the open-world Fable reboot isn't getting a blowout right now, despite also having a 2025 window attached to its last trailer.
