Microsoft Gaming has confirmed that the Xbox Games Showcase is set to return in 2025. The livestream will air on Sunday, June 8, and is designed to bring you a look at [<u>upcoming Xbox Series X games</u>](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-xbox-series-x-games/) from Microsoft's "first-party studios, in addition to incredible new titles from our third-party partners across the globe."

Xbox is also set to bring back the double feature framing, following the Starfield Direct in 2023 and the Black Ops 6 Direct in 2024. These dedicated sessions dive deep into one specific title following the main showcase, with [The Outer Worlds 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/the-outer-worlds-2-guide/) given the honors in 2025.

Xbox promises that The Outer Wilds 2 Direct will "bring you inside the walls of Obsidian Entertainment, revealing new gameplay, details, and developer insights."



The presence of The Outer Worlds 2 Direct sets the sci-fi RPG as one of the key Xbox Series X for the remainder of 2025, following the delay of the long-awaited [Fable reboot](https://www.gamesradar.com/fable-4-release-date-news-rumours/) into next year.

[Xbox Game Studios](https://www.gamesradar.com/xbox-game-studios-microsoft/) also has [State of Decay 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/state-of-decay-3-guide/) in development at Undead Labs, [Gears of War: E-Day](https://www.gamesradar.com/gears-of-war-e-day-guide/) at The Coalition, [Clockwork Revolution](https://www.gamesradar.com/clockwork-revolution-guide/) at inXile, [Perfect Dark](https://www.gamesradar.com/new-perfect-dark-guide/) at The Initiative with TBC release dates, although it wouldn't be a surprise to see all four of these at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025.

What's more unknown is whether we'll finally get an update on [Marvel's Blade](https://www.gamesradar.com/marvels-blade-guide/) from [Arkane](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/arkane-studios/), Rare's [Everwild](https://www.gamesradar.com/everwild-guide/), or Bethesda's [The Elder Scrolls 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-location-news-races/). And there's even less chance of getting anything new on [OD](https://www.gamesradar.com/od-overdose-hideo-kojima-xbox-guide/), given that Hideo Kojima is currently working to get [Death Stranding 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-2-guide/) out the door on June 26 for PS5.

The Xbox Games Showcase 2025, followed by The Outer Worlds 2 Direct, will air on June 8 at the following times:

While the Xbox Games Showcase 2024 had an in-person component, live from Los Angeles, the 2025 offering will be a digital-only presentation. Still, it will run in the position previously occupied by E3 – and now [Summer Game Fest](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/summer-game-fest/).

The big question on my mind right now is whether Xbox has the ability to draw attention away from the [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) (which is set to launch on June 5) or the firepower to battle for attention against [GTA 6](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/), for which Rockstar could drop a second trailer for at any point.

It's an exciting time regardless, with Xbox enjoying one of its best years of the generation so far – learn more about all that in our [Avowed review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/avowed-review/) and [South of Midnight review](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/south-of-midnight-review/).
