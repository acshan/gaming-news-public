The [mystery Star Wars strategy game from a group of XCOM veterans](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/that-mystery-star-wars-strategy-game-is-actually-a-tactics-game-from-a-bunch-of-xcom-veterans-and-suddenly-im-a-lot-more-excited-for-it/) has officially been announced as Star Wars: Zero Company ahead of a proper reveal at Star Wars Celebration in Japan later this week. EA is providing the first concrete information we've had on the [upcoming Star Wars game](https://www.gamesradar.com/upcoming-star-wars-games/) since it was vaguely teased years ago.

There's not much detail in [today's announcement](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/zero-company), which simply includes the title, a piece of art showing six characters, and the promise that this is "a single-player turn-based tactics game."

The artwork shows a clone trooper and a Mandalorian warrior, suggesting that the game will take place during the Clone Wars era of the [Star Wars timeline](https://www.gamesradar.com/star-wars-timeline/).

The art also features an astromech droid, a lightsaber-wielding alien Jedi, a human (or human-like) character in a sealed space suit, and a mustached man viewing a hologram image of a battle droid, further suggesting a Clone Wars setting.

A "world-exclusive first look" at Zero Company will happen as part of an April 19 panel at Star Wars Celebration, featuring [Lucasfilm](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/lucasfilm/) Games, Respawn, and BitReactor. Celebration will also bring us a [reveal for the second DLC pack coming to Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-dlc-2-will-officially-be-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration-japan-but-in-the-meantime-weve-got-a-teaser-image-showing-the-return-of-a-fan-favorite-from-clone-wars/).

A collaboration on a Star Wars strategy game between Respawn and BitReactor was announced way back in 2022, but it was only in 2024 that it became clear the title would be a turn-based tactics game building on the strength of its developers' experience making XCOM.
