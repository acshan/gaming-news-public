EA has seemingly scrapped yet another shooter in development at Respawn Entertainment, the beloved studio behind Titanfall (RIP), [Apex Legends](https://www.gamesradar.com/apex-legends/), and the Star Wars Jedi series.

As reported by [The Game Post](https://thegamepost.com/titanfall-developer-respawn-canceled-fps-game/), the news comes via a now-deleted LinkedIn post from former production coordinator Emilee Evans, who wrote that the "unannounced Incubation project I was a part of for the past year was canceled this week, so I am joining the group of extremely talented and kind people in the games industry searching for a new role."

We don't know much about what the unannounced project was or could have been, but old [job listings](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/game-design-director-incubation-team-at-respawn-entertainment-3789765830/) related to the game asked for a developer with experience "designing multiplayer FPS experiences."

What's more eyebrow-raising is the fact that this is the third scrapped shooter to come from Respawn in just two years. In 2023, EA reportedly threw [a single-player Titanfall and Apex Legends mash-up](https://www.gamesradar.com/ea-has-reportedly-canceled-a-single-player-game-in-the-titanfall-and-apex-legends-universe/) in the bin. A year later, the studio's Star Wars FPS, rumored to have been a Mandalorian game, was [also canceled](https://www.gamesradar.com/ea-is-laying-off-670-employees-sunsetting-games-and-canceling-development-of-future-licensed-ip-including-respawns-star-wars-fps/). Most curiously, all three cancellations have come just after EA's fiscal earnings reports - almost as if these decisions are being made by the spreadsheets themselves!

For now, Respawn is seemingly working on a third Star Wars Jedi game, more Apex Legends update, and [eventually an Apex Legends 2.0](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/apex-legends/months-after-ruling-out-an-apex-legends-2-ea-ceo-says-an-even-bigger-more-meaningful-apex-2-0-is-on-the-table-after-battlefield-6/).

The lack of anything original from the studio has been a massive bummer over the last few years, however. Titanfall 2 in particular is undoubtably one of the best shooters of all time - mixing first-person platforming, tense shootouts, and bombastic mech-shaped battles to create the most epic cocktail there is. The single-player campaign itself was also stuffed with non-stop novel ideas, so it's a shame to see their FPS chops used solely to deliver live service slop and battle royale updates.

*Respawn shooters might be stuck in a cancelation loop, but there are still many more *[<em>new games coming in 2025 and beyond</em>](https://www.gamesradar.com/video-game-release-dates/)*. *
