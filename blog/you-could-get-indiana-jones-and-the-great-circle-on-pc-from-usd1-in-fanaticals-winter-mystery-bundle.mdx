I’m right there with you. Your backlog is already 50 games long and you still need to play some of the year’s biggest games to weigh into GOTY conversations with your friends. To make matters worse, the latest blockbuster games are always the most expensive, and so the hope of finding them in Steam’s Christmas-time sales is pretty slim.

Of course, if you’re willing to look elsewhere, there are other ways you can try to secure Steam games on the cheap. If you haven’t heard of Fanatical, it’s one of the UK’s leading gaming retailers, and its Winter Sale is now on. The virtual retailer, which already has some great bargains in its discount aisle, has a bundle offering running that honestly sounds too good to be true - allow me to enlighten you.

[The Winter Mystery bundle](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8150600-15734741?sid=grd-us-8196575944138184662&url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/winter-mystery-bundle) lets you spend a vastly discounted rate to get up to 20 (yes, 20) random Steam keys. Among all the games you could land yourself with is the chance to get some of this year’s biggest AAA titles, including Silent Hill 2 Digital Deluxe Edition, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and even Space Marine 2. In fact, Fanatical is including 200 keys for Indiana Jones in the bundle, just waiting to be found.



Other games confirmed to be in the bundle include Silent Hill 2 Deluxe Edition, Dragon’s Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition, Last Epoch, and Helldivers 2 Super Citizen Edition.

The prices for these code bundles are less than the price tags of any one of the biggest AAA titles this year, with $1 getting you 1 key, $4.79 getting you 5 keys, and $7.49 netting you 10 keys. If you’re willing to spend over $10, then $10.79 will overflow your Christmas stocking with 15 keys, and the full 20 games can be had for only $13.99. As if these prices weren’t enticing enough, every customer who spends money on the Mystery bundle will get a 5% discount voucher to spend on their next Fanatical order.

The bundle begins today, Wednesday, December 18 at 4 pm GMT, so it could even be perfect for some last-minute Christmas shopping for the gamer in your life.

Fanatical also assures me that if you purchase more than one game in the bundle, you’ll be guaranteed to get codes for different games, and you’ll only have the chance to get codes for duplicate games if you purchase more than one bundle.



If the random fun and potential surprise of this bundle give you flashbacks from opening too many Overwatch loot boxes, there are some other great offers in [Fanatical’s Winter Sale](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8150600-15734741?sid=grd-us-1378739752091815296&url=https://www.fanatical.com/en/on-sale) instead. Here in the UK, Helldivers 2 is seeing a 30% reduction at the site already, bringing its tag down to £24.99. Similarly, Silent Hill 2 is discounted by 40% down to £35.99, and despite its release in the last few weeks, Indiana Jones is down to £50.39.

Games like these seldom see official Steam discounts for the first year or so that they’re on the virtual shelves, so Fanatical’s Winter Sale really could be the best way to ensure that missing games from your library appear under the tree this Christmas.
