[Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-guide/)'s performance woes might be down to mouse-related apps running in the background, developer [FromSoftware](https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/fromsoftware/) has warned, though there's no clue as to which apps could be causing the issue. Best check your PC for any mouse-related apps you might have running, as well as your wires for actual mice - just in case. 

[Elden Ring](https://www.gamesradar.com/elden-ring-guide/)'s slightly unreliable performance was once a problem in the base game too, but semi-frequent framerate dips have reared their head again in the recently-released mega-expansion. PC players in particular have complained about stuttering since the 1.12.2 update earlier this week, and FromSoft has a kind-of-fix prepared for us.

"In the PC version, the framerate may not be stable when playing the game while running a mouse-control related app," the developer's support account [tweets](https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1806520401314586632). "In that case, please try playing the game after stopping the mouse-control related app."

FromSoftware obviously doesn't say which mousy apps are causing problems, but if you happen to be running anything like the G Hub or Razor apps in the background and are also suffering with wonky performance in-game, than you're best bet is to close the software and try again.  

Mere two days after players descended into the Land of Shadow, [the Elden Ring DLC sat at a 'Mixed' Steam rating](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-debuts-to-mixed-steam-reactions-the-base-game-never-felt-this-ridiculously-difficult/) as initial user reviews complained about gruelling boss difficulty and performance troubles. Steam players later began to make peace with the expansion because [the user ratings recently slid into 'Mostly Positive' territory](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-back-up-to-mostly-positive-steam-reviews-after-difficulty-and-performance-issues-gave-it-a-mixed-reception/). All FromSoft needed was a little time for people to find their feet with the expansion's new [Scadutree Fragment](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/) progression system.
