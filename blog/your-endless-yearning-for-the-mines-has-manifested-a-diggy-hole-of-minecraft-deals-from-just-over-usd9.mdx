Minecraft discounts have been plentiful as Smooth Stone since the release of the [Minecraft movie](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/live-action-movies/a-minecraft-movie-review/). So that you don't have to waste time expeditioning the unknown to see what's on offer, I've been checking around for some funky Minecraft deals and rounding up the best ones below. That way, you can get on with building and mining, without getting caught up in an endless scrolling session.

I've manage to find some great deals in both the US and the UK, including Minecraft: Builders & Biomes, a strategy board game. Released back in 2019 for Minecraft's tenth anniversary, it's made by Ravensburger (the company behind Villainous, which is arguably one of the [best board games](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-board-games/) around).

With a tasty 15%, Builders & Biomes has dropped to [$33.98 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FRavensburger-Minecraft-Builders-Strategy-Exclusive%2Fdp%2FB07PXSJMHF%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-1266188773602666618-20) against its usual $39.99. That's a saving of just over $6. For UK folk, the same game is sadly still [¬£30.98 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2FRavensburger-26132-Minecraft-Builders-Biomes%2Fdp%2FB07PXSJMHF%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-5537097240825946469-21), though it's a little cheaper at [¬£29.99 on ToyVille](https://toyvilleshop.co.uk/product/minecraftbuildersbiomesboardgame/).

Aside from that, there's heaps of Minecraft Lego deals popping off at the moment, with the Lego Minecraft Baby Pig House currently just [$15.99 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FLEGO-Minecraft-House-Figures-Playset%2Fdp%2FB0DJ19VGDH%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-1280211653933074342-20). That's a 20% discount, and the cheapest we've ever seen it going for. UK folk get an even better 22% discount on the Baby Pig House, currently down to just [¬£13.98 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2FLEGO-Minecraft-Baby-House-Building%2Fdp%2FB0DHSDHCPK%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-1127817950645332659-21), against the usual ¬£17.99 price tag.

The Lego Minecraft Armadillo Mine Expedition set is also sitting at it's cheapest price ever right now for US folks. That's [$23.99 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FLEGO-Minecraft-Armadillo-Expedition-Figures%2Fdp%2FB0DJ1BM44B%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-us-2611548407185172557-20) against its $29.99 RRP. For UK Minecraft enjoyers, its still [¬£24.99 at Zavvi](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2549&awinaffid=103504&clickref=grd-us-9438443893776212908&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zavvi.com%2Ftoys%2Flego-minecraft-the-armadillo-mine-expedition-toy-set-21269%2F15833838.html) which is the standard price, sadly.

Still, UK folk can nab the Ender Dragon and End Ship Minecraft Lego set, complete with Ender Explorer, Ender Knight and a Minecraft Enderman for [¬£55.99 at Lego](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=24340&u1=grd-us-9909379853993714734&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fthe-ender-dragon-and-end-ship-21264), down from the usual ¬£69.99.

We've not had a chance to check out the Minecraft: Builders & Biomes board game, but its clearly a well thought out game. It's a much more simplified version of the Minecraft experience but you get the general gist without overcomplicating things. In it you can play as Steve or Alex, and will collect resources, and explore the overworld, revealing potential buildings and gaining experience points as you build ever more complex buildings. You'll also be battling mobs with crafted weapons, so there's more to it than just building.

As for the Lego sets I've added above, there are so many to choose from. Basically we'd recommend going first for the one that draws you in the most, and of course whichever one will fit on whatever space you still have left on your Lego shelf (or shelves).

If you nabbed each of the above Lego sets, that would tot up to a collective saving of $20.40, which isn't half bad when you just want to be surrounded head-to-toe in Minecraft merchandise having loved every second of Jack Black's Steve performance.
