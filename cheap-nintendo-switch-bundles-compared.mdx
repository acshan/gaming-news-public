Nintendo Switch bundles are getting better and better with every year the console stays on the shelves. The US had three bundle offers in circulation at the start of the year, one on each console type. Those have faded from the shelves this week, but you can still save on refurbished devices if you're looking to shave some cash off your purchase. Over in the UK there are still plenty of Nintendo Switch deals alive and kicking, from Nintendo itself but also Amazon and Currys.

While we might be in the endgame now - especially if the rumored [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-2-guide/) has anything to do with it, there's still fantastic value up for grabs if you know where to look. We scour the web for the latest and greatest Nintendo Switch deals every week, bringing you all our favorite discounts as and when they hit the shelves. You'll find all the lowest prices from the biggest retailers just below, and our top bundle picks further down the page as well. 

We generally see Nintendo Switch deals come and go in waves in both the US and the UK, with bounties of stock available one week and shelves left barren the next. 

Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. [Find out more about our reviews policy.](https://www.gamesradar.com/reviews-policy/)

If you're looking for Nintendo Switch deals on the console by itself, we're rounding up all the latest prices from retailers across the web just below. You'll find the best offers on the shelves right now in these comparison charts, but if you're after a bundle deal, you'll find all the latest discounts further down the page.

If you're just looking for a handheld-only console, it's worth checking out the [Nintendo Switch Lite deals](https://www.gamesradar.com/nintendo-switch-lite-price-and-deals-compared/) below. They are considerably cheaper than the main console (and much cheaper than the OLED model), but you are getting limited functionality without a docked mode. The standard price on these devices is $199 / £199.

To make sure you're getting a good deal, it's important to know the base prices of Switch consoles. In the US especially, we're used to seeing some merchants jack up the cost when rivals have sold out. 

The normal Nintendo Switch price is $299 in the US while the UK RRP is now £259 (dropping by £20 in September 2021). As for the Switch Lite, the US MSRP is $199 and the UK's price is set at £199. The Nintendo Switch OLED price is $349 in the US and £309 in the UK. 

Don't be caught out, if there's a listing that goes above these prices, double-check that it's part of a bundle or includes something noteworthy - and always ensure it's from a trusted seller!

Nintendo Switch Lite | Animal Crossing: New Horizons | <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Timmy-Tommy-s-Aloha-Edition-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Bundle-Full-Game-Download-Included%2F3162541096" data-link-merchant="walmart.com"" target="_blank">$199 $179 at Walmart
You're getting Animal Crossing: New Horizons (a $50 game at the best of times) for free here, and that limited edition console design for $20 off. That's the best value we've ever seen in a Nintendo Switch deal. 


Nintendo Switch OLED | Mario Kart 8 Deluxe | <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-Neon-Red-Blue-Joy-Con-Console-Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Game-Mightyskins-Voucher-Limited-Bundle-Import-US-Plug%2F290147826" data-link-merchant="walmart.com"" target="_blank">$340 at Walmart
While it's not quite as good as the official bundle we see over the holidays, this Nintendo Switch OLED package throws in a free copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe with the slightly discounted console.


Nintendo Switch OLED (Renewed) | <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Joy-Renewed%2Fdp%2FB09J6BGJ9X%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-link-merchant="Amazon US"" target="_blank">$348.99 $299.99 at Amazon
*Save $50 - *The Nintendo Switch OLED sticks close to that $349.99 MSRP, but you can pick up a renewed console for $50 off that price at Amazon right now.


Nintendo Switch OLED | <a href="https://clk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=197783&a=2049289&epi=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamecollection.net%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-neon-switch" data-link-merchant="thegamecollection.net"" target="_blank">£309.99 £259.95 at The Game Collection
*Save £50 - *It's not a bundle exactly, but this is still a fantastic discount. You're saving £50 on the OLED device by itself at The Game Collection this weekend - well worth noting if you're looking at the standard edition bundles just above.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga | <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0B5X4S9WG%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-21" data-link-merchant="Amazon UK"" target="_blank">£321.70 £283.44 at Amazon
It looks like a smaller saving on the page, but that's only because Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an older (and therefore cheaper) game these days. You're still getting a fantastic title and a £10 reduction on the RRP of the console itself here.


Nintendo Switch OLED | The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom | <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2Fdp%2FB0C6N5RWWJ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-21" data-link-merchant="Amazon UK"" target="_blank">£344.61 £304.99 at Amazon
Tears of the Kingdom is still a pricey game, so grabbing it for less than the price of the console by itself is a fantastic opportunity.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Mario Kart 8 Deluxe | 3 months Nintendo Switch Online | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=12777&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-model-neon-blueneon-red-mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-online-individual-3-month-90-day-membership-000000000010012403" data-link-merchant="store.nintendo.co.uk"" target="_blank">£309.99 at Nintendo
Nintendo has its own Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle back on the shelves this week, offering up a free game and three months of its online service for the standard price of the OLED device.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Princess Peach Showtime | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=22479&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-neon-red-and-blue-and-princess-peach-showtime-bundle%25C2%25A0-10262297.html" data-link-merchant="currys.co.uk"" target="_blank">£329 at Currys
It's rare to find such a recent release included in Nintendo Switch bundles, but Princess Peach Showtime is heavily discounted in this offer from Currys. Considering you're only spending an extra £20 on top of the standard RRP of the console that's a bargain.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Super Mario Bros. Wonder | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=22479&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-white-and-super-mario-bros.-wonder-bundle-10262292.html" data-link-merchant="currys.co.uk"" target="_blank">£329 at Currys
Super Mario Bros wonder is the most recent canon platformer to hit the shelves, and it's been pretty resistant to major discounts so far. Still, you'll find it bundled in with an OLED console for just £329 right now.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Animal Crossing: New Horizons | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=22479&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-neon-and-animal-crossing-new-horizons-bundle-10230826.html" data-link-merchant="currys.co.uk"" target="_blank">£329 at Currys
You're spending just £20 over the standard Nintendo Switch OLED asking price here and picking up a copy of Animal Crossing for the pleasure. This is still a £30+ game even today, making this a fantastic offer.


Nintendo Switch OLED | Hogwarts Legacy | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=22479&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-white-and-hogwarts-legacy-bundle-10262290.html" data-link-merchant="currys.co.uk"" target="_blank">£329 at Currys
Hogwarts Legacy is taking a serious price cut to meet this £329 bundle price. That's impressive considering this title has only hit the system relatively recently.


Nintendo Switch | Switch Sports | 3 months Nintendo Switch Online | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=12777&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fnintendo-switch-console-neon-blueneon-red-nintendo-switch-sports-set-000000000010012361" data-link-merchant="store.nintendo.co.uk"" target="_blank">£259.99 at Nintendo
Other retailers have so far run out of stock of this Nintendo Switch Sports bundle, but Ninty itself has come through this week. You're getting the free game, a standard edition console, and three months Switch Online here. We usually only see offers like this during the holiday sales themselves. 


Nintendo Switch | Super Mario Odyssey | <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=12777&awinaffid=103504&clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&p=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fnintendo-switch-red-super-mario-odyssey-the-super-mario-bros-movie-stickers-000000000010011123" data-link-merchant="store.nintendo.co.uk"" target="_blank">£259.99 at Nintendo
It's rare to see the standard edition taking part in bundles of this level. Despite its reduced RRP these days, we rarely see bundles below £279. However, Ninty itself has an excellent offer on the shelves today - a free copy of Super Mario Odyssey with this Choose One edition console.


There are now (or soon to be) three models of Nintendo Switch to choose from. Each one does offer a different experience, though, so it's important to choose the right version for you.

The only games we've seen with bundle options on the Nintendo Switch are Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Diablo 3, Splatoon 2, Fortnite, Fortnite Wildcat, Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Tennis Aces and 1-2 Switch, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Red & Blue, Pokemon Zacian and Zamazenda (Switch Lite), Fortnite, Monster Hunter Rise, and Dragon Quest XI S. However, it's worth noting that many of these special editions are no longer easy to find.

While UK retailers pair games and consoles themselves, we see far fewer Nintendo Switch bundles available in the US. That's because they are generally only available as part of a limited edition console release, or as part of a major sales period. You can still find these Nintendo Switch bundles on the shelves, but it's well worth making sure you're getting a fair price for your gear. Price inflation is rife here, with some third-party sellers going above $1,000 for rarer bundles. You should be paying $299 to $319 at the most.

It's easy to fall into a Nintendo Switch bundle trap. Retailers can sometimes charge more for a game when bundled in with a console than they're actually selling it for themselves separately. That means it's well worth checking for current deals on the game you are choosing, as sometimes bundle prices are set based upon an MSRP that doesn't reflect a game's current price. 

However, if you spot a Nintendo Switch bundle with a game or accessory for the same price as the console by itself it's an automatic winner.
