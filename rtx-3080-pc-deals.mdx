The best RTX 3080 PC deals aren't as abundant in 2024, but we're still on the look out for [Nvidia](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/nvidia/) Ampere rigs with nice price tags. Now that the RTX 4080 Super is now a thing, chances are you'll happen upon systems with new Lovelace GPUs inside while shopping. However, sticking with last gen components can help save you a chunk of change if you know where to look, enabling you to grab better specs without spending a fortune.

Many of the [best gaming PC](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/best-gaming-pc-pre-builds/) builds will now come with either an [RTX 4090](https://www.gamesradar.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review/) or lower spec RTX 40-series GPU inside, but RTX 3080 rigs are still considered powerhouses. Nvidia's Ampere GPU is still considered one of the [best graphics cards](https://www.gamesradar.com/best-pc-graphics-cards/) around, and it can boost fps using fancy AI upscaling tricks like DLSS 2. More often than not, systems with Nvidia's high-end GPU also feature respectable specs, serving as a base you can build upon with future upgrades.

To aid you on your quest to find a discounted rig, we've whipped up a collection of the best RTX 3080 gaming PC deals available today. From big-name brands like [Alienware](https://www.gamesradar.com/alienware-gaming-pc-guide/) and [Asus](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/asus/) to lesser-known builders with high specs, we've scoured a range of storefronts to save you some pennies.

Lenovo Legion T7 | [£2,999.99 <strong>£2,278.99 at Amazon</strong>](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=8426&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2FLenovo-Desktop-GeForce-Graphics-Windows%2Fdp%2FB09ZPRFDJZ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dgrd-gb-9115485228532023841-21)
*Save $721 - *Yes, this rig has an RTX 3080 Ti rather than the non-Ti version, but it's still a 80-class system for less. It's also armed with 32GB RAM, making it one of the highest spec 80-series deals we've come across recently. 

*Specs**: Intel Core i7, RTX 3080 Ti, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD.*

The exact cost of an RTX 3080 gaming PC will depend on the rest of the rig's specs, as components like CPU and RAM can drive up prices. If you're looking to pay less for a system, we'd suggest opting for  a build with an older processor, as you don't necessarily need an shiny new i7 or i9 to boost fps.

Both the RTX 4080 and RTX 3080 are exceptional graphics cards, but Nvidia's latest GPU line-up comes with exclusive features. If you're planning on playing at 4K with settings cranked up high, you'll be able to use DLSS 3 Frame Generation using a 4080 to increase frame rates. The 3080 can still use DLSS 2 and AI upscaling to improve performance, but the results aren't quite the same.

The RTX 3080 isn't exactly overkill in 2023, as new releases can push the GPU. That said, if you're not planning at playing at either 1440p or 4K with max settings enabled, you'd perhaps be better off picking up a cheaper RTX 4060 system. Not only can the new entry-level GPU fill in frame rate gaps using DLSS 3 and Frame Generation, but it can provide a high spec 1080p gaming experience while consuming less power.

And if you're looking to try your luck with individual components, these are the best prices available on the RTX 30 series in all its various forms.
