It's a bad time to enjoy platformers built on community level creations, as LittleBigPlanet 3 servers have shut down just a week after [support for Wii U servers and Super Mario Maker were killed](https://www.gamesradar.com/legendary-mario-dev-says-the-wild-rush-to-beat-every-super-mario-maker-level-before-servers-died-is-actually-pretty-cool/). But while Nintendo fans got to say goodbye to their game, the death of LittleBigPlanet came as a sudden shock.

[All LittleBigPlanet servers went offline in 2021](https://www.gamesradar.com/sony-turns-off-littlebigplanet-servers-after-recent-attacks-target-community-members/) in the midst of hacks that were bombarding players with offensive content. Later that year, [LittleBigPlanet 3 was brought back online](https://www.gamesradar.com/littlebigplanet-3-comes-back-online-but-only-on-ps4/), and since served as the only way fans could access 16 years worth of community-made levels dating back to the original 2008 game. Then, in January 2024, the devs announced that LittleBigPlanet 3 was once again going offline "temporarily."

Unfortunately, it seems that the temporary situation has now become permanent. "Due to ongoing technical issues which resulted in the LittleBigPlanet 3 servers for PS4 being taken offline temporarily in January 2024, the decision has been made to keep the servers offline indefinitely," the devs say in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1781427669801820406). "All online services including access to other players' creations for LittleBigPlanet 3 are no longer available."

It's an unceremonious end for a 16 year legacy of community content. Any such server shutdown comes as an ultimately understandable business decision, but equally, they're all distressing blows for game preservation. The timing means I can't help but think of the [Super Mario](https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/tag/super-mario/) Maker shutdown, which players had loads of advance notice for, leading to [one of the coolest community efforts in recent memory](https://www.gamesradar.com/after-280000-attempts-the-final-level-of-super-mario-maker-turns-out-to-be-a-fake-and-now-players-can-start-celebrating-a-victory-they-already-achieved-a-week-ago/).

Meanwhile, LittleBigPlanet - a more robust creation engine that predated Mario Maker by years - dies with a whimper. Community members [are reporting](https://twitter.com/LBPUnion/status/1781404355742101646) that resource servers, the servers that actually house levels and other player-made content, are currently still online, but with the game servers offline there's no way to access them. Still, some are holding out a faint glimmer of hope that maybe those levels will come back someday. I know I've got my fingers crossed for a LittleBigPlanet revival down the line, but I can't help feeling this is truly the end for one of PlayStation's greatest games.
